/* CSV library interface

   Date: July 15, 2008
   Updated: November 21,22, 2008 to use namespaces.
   Updated: December 22, 2009: changed the default dialect to a const and 
            modified lookup to take advantage of nonlinear pattern matching.
   Updated: June 11, 2010 to make use of rewritten C module and Pure's built
            in records.
   Updated: July 7, 2010 added space_before_quote_flag and trim_space_flag.
   Updated: July 15, 2010 changed the flags to allow space between before a
            quote or after a quote.
   Updated: July 16, 2010 added optional optional key selection of fields
   Updated: July 21, 2010 fixed write_escaped and write_quoted warnings
   Updated: Sep. 13, 2010 fixed problem writing integer or double matrices

/* Public dialect options

  delimiter:  Character used to separate fields.
              Type: string
              Default: ","

  escape:     Escape character used to embed delimiter, escape, or return
              characters. If the escape character is not null, then the
              quote character is ignored.
              Type: string
              Default: ""
              Notes:
                Reading: The escape character is dropped and the next char
                         is inserted into the field.
                Writing: The escape character is written into the output
                         stream before the delimiter, escape, or return
                         character.

  quote:      Quote character for embedding delimiters, quotes, and
              returns. The quote character is ignored if the escape
              character is defined.
              Type: string
              Default: "\""

  terminator: Value used for record termination when writing.
              Type: One of {LF, CRLF}. LF = "\n" and CRLF = "\r\n".
              Default: LF
	      Notes: 
                Reading: "\r" are always ignored except when embedded in
                         fields.

  quote_flag: Sets whether strings or numbers should be quoted.
              Type: One of {ALL, STRING, MINIMAL}
              Default: ALL
	      Notes:
	        Reading: ALL     - all fields are returned as strings.
			 STRING  - non quoted integer and double fields
                                         are converted.
                         MINIMAL - same as QUOTE_STRING.
                Writing: ALL     - all fields are written enclosed in
                                         quotes.
                         STRING  - only string fields are written
                                         enclosed in quotes.
                         MINIMAL - only fields containing quote, 
                                         delimiter, or return characters are
                                         written with enclosing quotes.

  space_around_quoted_field: Determines how whitespace between quotes and 
              delimiters should be treated.
              Type: One of {NO, LEFT, RIGHT, BOTH}
	      Default: NO
	      Notes:
	        Reading: NO    - follows RFC4180 rules.
                         LEFT  - allows space before a quoted field.
                         RIGHT - allows space after a quoted field.
			 BOTH  - allows space before and after a quoted field.
  
  trim_space: Determines whether leading or trailing whitespace inside a field
              should be removed.
             Type: One of {NO, LEFT, RIGHT, BOTH}
             Default: NO
             Notes:
               Reading: NO    - follows RFC4180 rules.
                        LEFT  - trims leading whitespace from a field.
			RIGHT - trims trailing whitespace from a field.
			BOTH  - trims both leading and trailing whitespace
                                from a field. 
               CAUTION: Trimming space may allow conversion of numbers if
                        quote_flag = MINIMAL since space before a number in a
                        field is normally interpreted as a string.
