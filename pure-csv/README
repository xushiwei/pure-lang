The CSV library provides an interface for reading and writing comma 
separated value files that is loosely based on Python's CSV module 
(http://docs.python.org/lib/module-csv.html).

Installation
------------

Run ``make`` to compile the module and ``make install`` (as root) to 
install it in the Pure library directory. This requires GNU make. The 
``make install`` step is only necessary for system-wide installation.

The ``make`` utility tries to guess your Pure installation directory 
and platform-specific setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some 
variables manually. In particular, ``make install prefix=/usr`` sets 
the installation prefix, and ``make PIC=-fPIC`` or some similar flag 
might be needed for compilation on 64 bit systems. Please see the 
Makefile for details.

Usage
-----

Data records are represented as lists of strings, integers, and 
doubles. Three predefined dialects are provided; RFC4180 (default for
Windows), UNIX (default for Linux, \*BSD, and Unix), and EXCEL; but
procedures and options are provided to create many CSV dialects. See
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt) for more details about the 
RFC4180 standard.

Examples of reading and writing CSV files are provided in the file
"samples.pure" located in the examples subdirectory.

Handling Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Input that does not abide by dialect rules or records containing
field types other than strings, integers, and doubles produce a special
``csv::error msg`` term, where ``msg`` is a string describing the 
particular error. Your application should either check for these 
or have ``csv::error`` defined to directly handle errors in some way 
(e.g., provide a default value, or raise an exception).

:Example:::

  > using system, csv;
  > csv::str [1%4, 1%3]; // rational numbers are not allowed
  csv::error "field 1: invalid conversion type."
  > /* Now, print a message and
  >    perform an exit action on the error */
  > csv::error msg = printf "CSV Error: %s\n" msg $$ exit 0;
  > csv::str [1%4, 1%3];
  CSV Error: field 1: invalid conversion type.

Creating Dialects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _dialect:

``dialect list``
  Creates a dialect from a list of dialect option pairs. Option 
  pairs are denoted ``a=>b`` where ``a`` is the option and ``b`` is
  the option's value. The list of possible options and option values
  are presented below.

  .. _DELIMETER:
  
  - ``DELIMITER`` - Field delimiter.

    * Values - any string.
    * Default - ``","``.

  .. _ESCAPE:

  - ``ESCAPE`` - Embedded escape character.

    * Values - any string.
    * Default - ``"\""``.
    * Notes - When reading, the escape character is dropped and the next 
      char is inserted into the field. When writing, the escape 
      character is written into the output stream.
  
  .. _QUOTE:
  
  - ``QUOTE`` - Quote character.
  
    * Values - any string.
    * Default - ``"\""``.
    * Notes - If embedded quotes are doubled, ``ESCAPE`` must equal the 
      value of ``QUOTE``. The dialect function will automatically set 
      the ``ESCAPE`` string to that of ``QUOTE`` if ``ESCAPE`` is not 
      specified in the dialect argument list.
  
  .. _QUOTING_STYLE:

  - ``QUOTING_STYLE`` - Sets the quoting style of strings and/or 
    numbers.

    * Values - One of {``QUOTE_ALL``, ``QUOTE_STRINGS``, 
      ``QUOTE_EMBEDDED``}.
    * Default - ``QUOTE_STRINGS``.

  .. _LINETERMINATOR:

  - ``LINETERMINATOR`` - Record termination value.

    * Values - any string.
    * Default: ``"\r\n"``.

  .. _SKIPSPACE:

  -  ``SKIPSPACE`` - Skip leading white space flag.

    * Values - boolean {1=true, 0=false}.
    * Default - 1.
    * Note - Quoted fields always retain white space.

  :Example:
  
  The following example shows how to construct a dialect to read tab 
  delimited files without quoted strings::

    > using csv;
    > const d = csv::dialect [
    >   csv::DELIMITER => "\t", 
    >   csv::QUOTING_STYLE => csv::QUOTE_EMBEDDED];
    > csv::list ("\"John\tSmith\"\t23\t4.5\tfreshman", d);
    ["John\tSmith",23,4.5,"freshman"]
    >

String and List Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _str:

``str list|(list, dialect)``
  Converts a list to a CSV formatted string. If the argument is a 
  list, conversion is performed using RFC 4180 rules 
  (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt). If the argument is given
  as a tuple, then the conversion is performed according to the 
  dialect's specifications. A ``csv::error msg`` term is invoked if a 
  fields contains data other than a string, integer, or a double types.
  
  :Examples:
  
  ::
  
    > using csv;
    > csv::str [1,"",3.00,"bob \"plays drums\""];
    "1,\"\",3,\"bob \"\"plays drums\"\"\"\n"
    > const d = csv::dialect [csv::DELIMITER => "\t"];
    > csv::str ([1,"",3.00,"bob \"plays drums\""], d);
    "1\t\"\"\t3\t\"bob \"\"plays drums\"\"\"\n"
    >     

.. _list:

``list string|(string, dialect)``
  Creates a list of string or numeric fields from a CSV formatted
  string. If the argument is given as a string, then the conversion 
  is performed using RFC 4180 rules 
  (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt). If the argument is given as
  a tuple, then the conversion is performed according to the rules 
  specified by the dialect. An invalidly formatted CSV string returns
  a ``csv::error msg`` term.
  
  :Examples:
  
  ::
  
    > using csv;
    > csv::list "1,\"\",3,\"bob \"\"plays drums\"\"\"\n";
    [1,"",3,"bob \"plays drums\""]
    > const d = csv::dialect [csv::DELIMITER => "\t"];
    > csv::list ("1\t\"\"\t3\t\"bob \"\"plays drums\"\"\"\n", d);
    [1,"",3,"bob \"plays drums\""]
    >

File Reading Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``fgets file|(file, dialect)``
  The ``fgets`` function is equivalent to ``csv::list`` except that 
  reading is from a file. The file must first be opened using ``fopen`` 
  which is defined in the system library (system.pure).

``csv::fget file|(file, dialect)``
  This function reads a whole file and returns a list of records.
  This procedure should only be used on data files that are small
  enough to fit in the computer's primary memory.
  
  :Examples:
  
  ::
  
    > using system, csv;
    > /* Write a file to test */
    > let f = fopen "test.csv" "w";
    > csv::fput [[1,"a"], [2,"b"], [3,"c"]] f;
    ()
    > fclose f;
    0
    > let f = fopen "test.csv" "r";
    > csv::fgets f;
    [1,"a"]
    > fclose f;
    0
    >

File Writing Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When modifying CSV files that will be imported into Microsoft Excel,
fields with significant leading 0s should be written using a 
``"=""0..."""`` formatting scheme. This same technique will work for
preserving leading space too. Again, this quirk should only be
necessary for files to be imported into MS Excel.

``fputs list file|(file, dialect)``
  The function is equivalent to ``csv::str`` except that writing is
  to a file. The file must first be opened using ``fopen`` which can 
  be found in the system library.
  
``fput list file|(file, dialect)``
  This function writes a list of records to a file. Each record is
  converted according to the rules stated in the ``csv::str``
  procedure.

  :Examples:
  
  ::
  
    > using system, csv;
    > /* Write a file to test */
    > let f = fopen "test.csv" "w";
    > csv::fput [[1,"a"], [2,"b"], [3,"c"]] f;
    ()
    > fclose f;
    0
    > let f = fopen "test.csv" "r";
    > /* Read the first record */
    > csv::fgets f;
    [1,"a"]
    > /* Read the next record */
    > csv::fgets f;
    [2,"b"]
    > fclose f;
    0
    >
