Version @stllibversion@, |today|

| Peter Summerland <p.summerland@gmail.com>

pure-stllib is an "umbrella" package that contains a pair of Pure addons,
pure-stlvec and pure-stlmap. These addons provide `Pure`_ interfaces to a
selection of containers provided by the `C++ Standard Library`_, specialized
to hold pointers to arbitrary Pure expressions. pure-stlvec is a Pure
interface to C++'s vector and the STL algorithms that act on them. pure-stlmap
is an interface to six (of the eight) of C++'s associative containers: map,
set, multimap, multiset, unordered_map and unordered_set.

pure-stlib-@stllibversion@ contains pure-stlvec-@stlvecversion@ and
pure-stlmap-@stlmapversion@.

Installation
============

pure-stllib-@stllibversion@ requires at least Pure 0.50. The latest version of
Pure is available at http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/downloads/list.

The latest version of the source code for pure-stllib can be downloaded from
http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/pure-stllib-@stllibversion@.tar.gz.
 
To install pure-stllib (on Linux), extract the source code (e.g., tar -xzf
pure-stllib-@stllibversion@.tar.gz), cd to the pure-stllib-@stllibversion@
directory, and run ``make``. After this you can (and should) also run ``make
check`` to run a few unit tests to make sure that pure-stlvec-@stlvecversion@
and pure-stlmap-@stlmapversion@ work properly on your system. If ``make
check`` works, run ``sudo make install`` to install
pure-stlvec-@stlvecversion@ and pure-stlmap-@stlmapversion@. Run ``sudo make
uninstall`` to remove them. 

``make`` tries to guess your Pure installation directory and platform-specific
setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables manually. In
particular, ``make install prefix=/usr`` sets the installation prefix. Please
see the Makefile for details.

Usage
=====

The functions provided by pure-stlvec and pure-stlmap are made available by
importing one or more modules.

pure-stlvec provides two basic modules:

  stlvec - support for stlvecs (wrappers around C++ vectors)

  stlvec::algorithms - STL algorithms specialized to act on stlvecs

pure-stlmap provides three modules :

  stlmap - support for stlmap and stlset (wrappers around C++ map and set)

  stlmmap - support for stlmmap and stlmset (wrappers around C++ mulitmap and multiset)

  stlhmap - support for stlhmap and stlhset (wrappers around C++ unordered_map and unordered_set) 

The functions that act on containers provided by the stlmap, stlmmap, stlhmap
and stlvec modules are summarized in a rudimentary cheatsheet,
pure-stllib-cheatsheet.pdf, which can be found in the stllib directory.
