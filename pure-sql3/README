Introduction
============

SQLite is a software library that implements an easy to use,
self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL
database engine. SQLite is not intended to be an enterprise database
engine like Oracle or PostgreSQL. Instead, SQLite strives to be small,
fast, reliable, and above all simple. See `Appropriate Uses For SQLite`_.

.. _Appropriate Uses For SQLite: http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html

Sql3 is a wrapper around SQLite's C interface that provides Pure
programmers access to almost all of SQLite's features, including many
that are not available through Pure's generic ODBC interface.

Simple Example
--------------

Here is a simple example that opens a database file "readme.db"
(creating it if it does not exist), adds a table "RM", populates "RM"
and executes a query.

::

  pure-sql3$> pure -q
  > 

  > using sql3; using namespace sql3;

  > let dbp = open "readme.db";

  > exec dbp "create table if not exists RM (name text, age integer)";

  > exec dbp "delete from RM";

  > let sp1 = prep dbp "ci" "insert into RM values (?,?)";

  > exec sp1 ("Sam",20);

  > exec sp1 ("Fred",22);

  > let sp2 = prep dbp "ci:i" "select * from RM where age > ?";

  > exec sp2 18;
  [["Sam",20],["Fred",22]]

.. namespace:: sql3

The Sql3 functions, :func:`open`, :func:`prep` and :func:`exec` encapsulate
the core functionality of SQLite, and in many cases are all you need to use
SQLite effectively.

More Examples
-------------

The examples subdirectory of pure-Sql3 contains several files that
further illustrate basic usage as well as some of Sql3's more
sophisticated features. These include readme.pure, a short file that
contains the examples included herein. If you are using emacs pure-mode
you can load readme.pure into a buffer and execute the examples line by
line (pressing C-c C-c) (as well as experiment as you go).

SQLite Documentation
--------------------

SQLite's home page provides excellent documentation regarding its SQL
dialect as well as its C interface. Comments in this document
regarding SQLite are not meant to be a substitute for the actual
documentation and should not be relied upon, other than as general
observations which may or may not be accurate.  The best way to use
Sql3 is to get familiar with SQLite and its C interface and go
directly to the `SQLite Site Map`_ for authoritative answers to any
specific questions that you might have.

.. _`SQLite Site Map`: http://www.sqlite.org/sitemap.html

In the rest of this document, it is assumed the reader has some
familiarity with SQLite and has read `An Introduction To The SQLite
C/C++ Interface`_.

.. _An Introduction To The SQLite C/C++ Interface:
    http://www.sqlite.org/cintro.html

Sqlite3 - The SQLite Command-Line Utility
-----------------------------------------

The SQLite library includes a really nice command-line utility named
sqlite3 (or sqlite3.exe on Windows) that allows the user to manually
enter and execute SQL statements against a SQLite database (and much
more).

.. http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html

This tool is an invaluable aid when working with SQLite in general and
with Sql3 in the Pure interpreter in particular. For example, after
entering the Pure statements from the Simple Example above, you could
start a new terminal, cd to pure-sql3, type "sqlite3 readme.db" at the
prompt, and see the effect the Pure statements had on the database:

.. code-block:: sql

  pure-sql3$> sqlite3 readme.db
  SQLite version 3.6.16
  Enter ".help" for instructions
  Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"

  sqlite> select * from RM;
  Sam|20
  Fred|22

For bottom up REPL development, sqlite3 and Pure are an excellent
combination.

Installation
============

Get the latest source from
http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/pure-sql3-@version@.tar.gz.

Unless you already have them on your machine, download SQLite and
sqlite3 from the SQLite website and install as indicated. To install
Sql3, cd to the pure-sql3 directory, run ``make``, and then run ``sudo
make install`` (on Linux).

Data Structure
==============

From a client's perspective, the most important of SQLite's data structures
are the database connection object "sqlite3" and the prepared statement object
"sqlite3_stmt". These are opaque data structures that are made available to
users of SQLite's C interface via pointers, sqlite3* and sqlite3_stmt*. At
appropriate times, Sql3 creates "cooked" versions of these pointers that can
be used (with care) to call native C functions exposed by SQLite's C
interface.

Sql3 introduces two new data types, "db_ptr" and "stmt_ptr" which refer to the
cooked versions of sqlite3* and sqlite3_stmt*, respectively. These two
new data types are defined using :func: `type`, and therefore can be used as
type tags in rule patterns or as the first parameter passed to in the typep
function. It follows that all db_ptrs are sqlite3* pointers and all stmt_ptrs
are sqlite3_stmt* pointers. Thus, using dbp and sp1 from the introductory
example::

  > typep db_ptr dbp, pointer_type dbp;
  1, "sqlite3*"

  > typep stmt_ptr sp1, pointer_type sp1;
  1, "sqlite3_stmt*"

The converse, of course, is not true, as SQLite knows nothing about Sql3, and
db_ptrs and stmt_ptrs carry other information in addtion to the underlying
pointers provided to them by SQLite.

Core Database Operations
========================

The core database operations are (a) opening and closing database
connections and (b) preparing, executing and closing prepared
statements.

Database Connections
--------------------

Generally speaking, the first step in accessing a database is to
obtain a db_ptr that references a database connection object. Once the
db_ptr is obtained, it can be used to construct prepared statements
for updating and querying the underlying database. The last step is
usually to close the database connection (although this is will be done
automatically by Sql3 when the db_ptr goes out of scope).

Opening a Database Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Sql3 :func:`open` constructs a database connection and returns a db_ptr
that refers to the connection.

.. function:: open (file_path::string [,access_mode::int[,custom_bindings]])

   opens a SQLite database file whose name is given by the file_path argument
   and returns a db_ptr for the associated database connection object created
   by SQLite.

Example::

  >  let dbp2 = open "abc.db"; dbp2;
  #<pointer 0x992dff8>

If the filename is ":memory:" a private, temporary in-memory database
is created for the connection.

The basic access modes are:

* SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY - the database is opened in read-only mode. If the
  database does not already exist, an error is returned.

* SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE - the database is opened for reading and writing if
  possible, or reading only if the file is write protected by the operating
  system. In either case the database must already exist, otherwise an
  error is returned.

* SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE | SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE - the database is opened for
  reading and writing, and is creates it if it does not already exist. This
  is the default value that is used if the flags argument is omitted.

* SQLITE_OPEN - an alias for SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE | SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE
  provided by Sql3.

These flags can be combined with SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX
SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE
to control SQLite's threading and shared cache features. All of these
flags are exported by Sql3.

The optional custom_bindings argument allows the user to set up
customized binding and fetching behavior for prepared statements
associated with the returned db_ptr. (See `Custom Binding Types for
Prepared Statements`_)

Failure to Open a Database Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If SQLite cannot open the connection, it still returns a pointer to a
database connection object that must be closed. In this case, :func:`open`
automatically closes the the connection object and then throws an
exception. E.g.,::

  > catch error (open ("RM_zyx.db",SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY));
  error (sql3::db_error 14 "unable to open database file [open RM_zyx.db]")


Apparently, SQLite does not verify that a file is a valid SQLite
database when it opens a connection. However, if the file is corrupted
SQLite will return an error when the connection is used.

Testing a db_ptr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can test any object to see if it is a db_ptr using (typep db_ptr):

.. namespace:: ::

.. function:: typep /sql3dbptr db_ptr x

   returns 1 if x is a db_ptr returned by open, and 0 if it is not.

You can also determine if a db_ptr's data connection is open.

.. namespace:: sql3

.. function:: is_open dbp::db_ptr

   returns 1 if the database connection referenced by dbp is open.

Closing a Database Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a database connection object is no longer needed, it should be closed
so that SQLite can free the associated resources.

.. function:: close dbp::db_ptr

   if the database connection referenced by the db_ptr dbp is open,
   close it using sqlite3_close; otherwise do nothing.

Before calling ``sqlite3_close``, :func:`close` finalizes all prepared
statements associated with the connection being closed. Sql3 will
detect and throw a db_error if an attempt is subsequently made to
execute a statement associated with the closed database connection. ::

  > let dbp2_sp = prep dbp2 "ci:" "select * from RM";

  > exec dbp2_sp ();
  [["Sam",20],["Fred",22]]

  > close dbp2;

  > catch error (exec dbp2_sp);
  error (sql3::db_error 0 "Attempt to exec on a closed db_ptr.")

If a db_ptr goes out of scope, Sql3 will automatically call ``sqlite3_close``
to close the referenced database connection, but only if the connection has
not already been closed by :func:`close`. Thus, for example, it is not
necessary to use a catch statement to ensure that Sqlite3 resources are
properly finalized when a db_ptr is passed into code that could throw an
exception.

When debugging, this activity can be observed by editing sql3.pure,
changing "const SHOW_OPEN_CLOSE = 0;" to "const SHOW_OPEN_CLOSE = 1;"
and running sudo make install in the pure-sql3 directory. This will
cause a message to be printed whenever a db_ptr or stmt_ptr is created
or finalized.

N.B. You should never call the native C interface function``sqlite3_close``
with a db_ptr. If the referenced database connection is closed by such a call,
a subsequent call to :func:`close` on this db_ptr (including the call that
will automatically occur when the db_ptr goes out of scope) will cause a seg
fault.

Prepared Statements
-------------------

The native SQLite C interface provides five core functions needed to execute a
SQL statement.

* sqlite3_prepare_v2
* sqlite3_bind
* sqlite3_step
* sqlite3_column
* sqlite3_finalize

Using the C interface, the basic procedure is to prepare a statement using
``sqlite3_prepare_v2``, bind its parameters using ``sqlite3_bind``, step it
using ``sqlite3_step`` one or more times until it is done and then finalize it
using ``sqlite3_finalize``. Each time ``sqlite3_step`` returns SQLITE_ROW, use
``sqlite3_column`` to fetch the row's values. Here ``sqlite3_bind`` and
``sqlite3_column`` represent families of bind and column functions, rather
than actual functions, with one member for each of the basic data types
recognized by SQLite. Thus, for example, ``sqlite_bind_double`` is the
function one would use to bind a prepared statement with an argument of type
double.

Sql3 encapsulates these procedures in four functions: :func:`prep`,
:func:`exec`, :func:`lexec` and :func:`finalize`.

Constructing Prepared Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Sql3 you can use :func:`prep` to construct a prepared statement and
obtain a stmt_ptr that refers to it.

.. function:: prep dbp::db_ptr binding_string::string sql_statement::string

   constructs a prepared statement object and returns a stmt_ptr that
   references it. ``dbp`` must be a db_ptr or the rule will not
   match. ``sql_statement`` is the SQL statement that will be executed
   when the prepared statement is passed to :func:`exec`.

Basically, :func:`prep` just passes ``dbp`` and ``sql_statement`` on to
``sqlite3_prepare_v2`` and returns a sentry guarded version of the
sqlite3_stmt* it receives back from ``sqlite3_prepare_v2``. SQL
statements passed to :func:`prep` (and ``sqlite3_prepare_v2``) can have
argument placeholders, indicated by "?", "?nnn", ":AAA", etc, in which
case the argument placeholders must be bound to values using
``sqlite_bind`` before the prepared statement is passed to
``sqlite3_step``.  Hence the ``binding_string``, which is used by Sql3
to determine how to bind the prepared statement's argument
placeholders, if any. The binding string also tells Sql3 how to fetch
values in the ``sqlite3_column`` phase of the basic prepare, bind,
step, fetch, finalize cycle dictated by the SQlite C interface.

In the following two examples, the "c" and "i" in the binding strings
indicate that (a) a string and an int will be used to bind ``sp1``,(b)
an int will be used to bind ``sp2`` and (c) ``sp2``, when executed,
will return a result set in the form of a list of sublists each of
which contains a string and an int.

::

  > let sp1 = prep dbp "ci" "insert into RM values (?,?)";

  > let sp2 = prep dbp "ci:i" "select * from RM where age > ?";

In general, the characters in the type string before the ":", if any,
indicate the types in the result set. Those that occur after the ":",
if any, indicate the types of the arguments used to bind the prepared
statement object. If the type string does not contain a ":", the
characters in the type string, if any, are the types of binding
arguments.

Sql3 provides the following set of "core" binding types:

==== ================ ===========
Type Pure Argument    SQLite Type
==== ================ ===========
b    (int, pointer)   blob
c    string           text (utf8)
d    double           float
i    int              int
k    int or bigint    int64
l    bigint           blob
n    Sql3::SQLNULL    NULL
x    expression       blob
v    variant          variant
==== ================ ===========

The "**b**" or blob type is different from the rest in that the Pure
argument is specified as a pair. The first element of the pair
indicates the length in bytes of the object to be stored and the
second element indicates its location in memory. The "**c**" type
stands for string (as in "char*"), "**d**" stands for double and
"**i**" stands for int.  The "**k**" type stands for "key" and maps
Pure ints and bigints (within the range of int64) to int64 values in
the database.  This type is useful when dealing with SQLite's "integer
primary keys" and "rowids" both of which are int64.  The "**l**" type,
in contrast applies to all bigints (and not to ints) and it maps
bigints onto blobs, which are generally meaningless in SQL math
expressions.  The "**n**" type can only appear on the binding side of
a type string. The "**v**" type stands for any of "b", "c", "d", "i"
or "n", based on the type of the binding argument. A "v" type will be
fetched from SQLite according to the native SQLite column type of the
corresponding column.  The "**x**" type is used to store and
reconstruct Pure expressions as binary objects, using the
:func:`~::val/blob` and :func:`~::blob` functions provided by the Pure
prelude.

Users can define custom binding types and pass them as a third
parameter to :func:`open`. The resulting db_ptr can be used with the
custom binding types to construct prepared statements using :func:`prep`.

Testing a stmt_ptr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can determine if a given expression is a stmt_ptr using typep.

.. namespace:: ::

.. function:: typep /sql3stmtptr stmt_ptr x

   returns 1 if ``x`` is a stmt_ptr, otherwise returns 0.

.. namespace:: sql3

Executing Prepared Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Sql3, the bind, step, column, step, column ... cycle is encapsulated in
the :func:`exec` and :func:`lexec` functions.

.. function:: exec sp::stmt_ptr args

   use ``args`` to bind the prepared statement referenced by ``sp``, execute
   it and return the result set as a list. The first parameter, ``sp`` must be
   a valid stmt_ptr or the rule will fail.

The second parameter, ``args``, is a tuple or list of arguments whose
number and type correspond to the bind parameter types specified in
the call to :func:`prep` that produced the first parameter ``sp``.

Thus, using sp1 and sp2 defined in the introductory example::

  > exec sp1 ("Tom",30);  //insert Tom
  []

  > exec sp2 19;          //select age > 19
  [["Sam",20],["Fred",22],["Tom",30]]

An error is thrown if the args do not correspond to the specified types. ::

  > catch error (exec sp2 "a");
  error (sql3::db_error 0 "\"a\" does not have type int")

If a prepared statement does not have any binding parameters,
the call to :func:`exec` should use ``()`` as the binding argument. ::

  > let sp3 = prep dbp "c:" "select name from RM";

  > exec sp3 ();
  [["Sam"],["Fred"],["Tom"]]

Extra care is required when executing prepared statements that take a
blob argument because it must be a pair. In order to preserve the
tuple as a pair, binding arguments that include a blob should passed
to exec as a list. If passed as a member of a larger tuple, it will be
treated as two arguments due to the nature of tuples. ::

  > let blb = (100,ptr);

  > (a,blb,c);
  a,100,ptr,c

  > [a,blb,c];
  [a,(100,ptr),c]

Thus something like "``exec stpx [a,blb,c]``" would work fine, while "``exec
stpx (a,blb,c)``" would produce a Sql3 binding exception.

Executing Lazily
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :func:`exec` function returns result sets as eager lists which can
sometimes be inefficient or simply not feasible for large result
sets. In such cases it is preferable to use :func:`lexec` instead of
:func:`exec`.

.. function:: lexec stmp::stmt_ptr args

   same as :func:`exec` except that it returns a lazy list.

Example::

  > lexec sp2 19;
  ["Sam",20]:#<thunk 0xb6475ab0>

Note that no changes to ``sp2`` were required. In addition, for most
purposes the lazy list returned by :func:`lexec` can be processed by the
same code that processed the eager list returned by :func:`exec`.

Executing Directly on a db_ptr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For statements that have no parameters and which do not return results,
:func:`exec` can be applied to a db_ptr.

.. function:: exec dbp::db_ptr sql_statement::string

   constructs a temporary prepared statement using ``sql_statement``. The SQL
   statement cannot contain argument placeholders and cannot be a select
   statement.

Example::

  > exec dbp "create table if not exists RM (name varchar, age integer)";

Executing Against a Busy Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SQLite allows multiple processes to concurrently read a single
database, but when any process wants to write, it locks the entire
database file for the duration of its update.

When the native SQLite C interface function ``sqlite3_step`` (used by
``exec``) tries to access a file that is locked by another process, it treats
the database as "busy" and returns the SQLITE_BUSY error code. If this happens
in a call to :func:`exec` or :func:`lexec`, a :cons:`db_busy` exception will
be thrown.

You can adjust SQLite's behavior using ``sqlite3_busy_handler`` or
``sqlite3_busy_timeout``.

If the statement is a COMMIT or occurs outside of an explicit
transaction, then you can retry the statement. If the statement is not
a COMMIT and occurs within a explicit transaction then you should
rollback the transaction before continuing.

Grouping Execution with Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No changes can be made to a SQLite database file except within a
transaction. Transactions can be started manually by executing a BEGIN
statement (i.e., exec dbp "BEGIN"). Manually started transactions persist
until the next COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement is executed. Transactions are also
ended if an error occurs before the transaction is manually ended using a
COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement. This behavior provides the means make a series
of changes "atomically."

By default, SQLite operates in autocommit mode. In autocommit mode,
any SQL statement that changes the database (basically, anything other
than SELECT) will automatically start a transaction if one is not
already in effect. As opposed to manually started transactions,
automatically started transactions are committed as soon as the
execution of the related statement completes.

The upshot of this, in Sql3 terms, is that unless a transaction is
started manually, the database will be updated each time :func:`exec` is
called. For a long series of updates or inserts this a can be very
slow. The way to avoid this problem is to manually begin and end
transactions manually.

Sql3 provides the following convenience functions all of which simply
call :func:`exec` with the appropriate statement. For example ``begin
dbp`` is exactly the same as ``exec dbp "BEGIN"``.

.. function:: begin dbp::db_ptr
.. function:: begin_exclusive dbp::db_ptr
.. function:: begin_immediate dbp::db_ptr
.. function:: commit dbp::db_ptr
.. function:: rollback dbp::db_ptr
.. function:: savepoint dbp::db_ptr save_point::string
.. function:: release dbp::db_ptr save_point::string
.. function:: rollback_to dbp::db_ptr save_point::string

Note that transactions created using :func: `begin` and :func: `commit` do not
nest. For nested transactions, use :func: `savepoint` and :func: `release`.

Finalizing Prepared Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a prepared statement is no longer needed it should be finalized
so that SQLite can free the associated resources.

.. function:: finalize sp::stmt_ptr

   finalize the prepared statement referenced by ``sp``, which must be a
   stmt_ptr previously returned by :func:`prep`.

Often there is no need to call :func:`finalize` for a given stmt_ptr
because it will be automatically called when the stmt_ptr goes out of
scope. 

If the stmt_ptr is associated with a database connection that has been
closed (which would have caused an exception to be thrown), an attempt
to finalize it, including the automatic finalization can occur when
stmt_ptr goes out of scope, will cause an exception to be thrown.

::

  > catch error (finalize dbp2_sp);
  error (sql3::db_error 0 "finalize: STMT attached to a closed db_ptr.")

Multiple calls to :func:`finalize` are fine. In contrast, the corresponding
native C interface function, ``sqlite3_finalize`` will cause a seg
fault if called with a pointer to a finalized prepared statement
object. This is the main reason why you should never call
``sqlite3_finalize`` with a stmt_ptr. If the prepared statement
referenced by the stmt_ptr is finalized by such a call, a subsequent
call to :func:`finalize` with the stmt_ptr (including the call that will
automatically occur when the stmt_ptr goes out of scope) will cause a
seg fault.

Exceptions
----------

Sql3 throws two types of exceptions, one for outright errors and one
for database "busy" conditions.

.. constructor:: db_error ec msg

   When a Sql3 function detects an error it throws an exception of the form
   "``db_error ec msg``" where ec is an error code and msg is the
   corresponding error message. If ec>0, the error was detected by SQLite
   itself, and ec and msg are those returned by SQLite. If ec==0, the error
   was detected by Sql3 and msg is a Sql3 specific description of the
   error. E.g., ::

     > db_error_handler (db_error ec msg) = ()
     > when
     >   source = if ec > 0 then "SQLite" else "Sql3";
     >   printf "%s db_error: ec %d, %s\n" (source,ec,msg);
     > end;
     > db_error_handler x = throw x;

     > catch db_error_handler (exec dbp "select * from NO_TABLE");
     SQLite db_error: ec 1, no such table: NO_TABLE

.. constructor:: db_busy dbp

   Sql3 functions :func:`exec` and :func:`lexec` throw exceptions of the form
   "``db_busy dbp``", where ``dbp`` is a db_ptr, if they are prevented from
   executing successfully because the database referenced by ``dbp`` is locked
   (See `Executing Against a Busy Database`_).

SQLite Error Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a list, as of January 31, 2011, of SQLite's error codes. ::

  SQLITE_ERROR        1   /* SQL error or missing database */
  SQLITE_INTERNAL     2   /* Internal logic error in SQLite */
  SQLITE_PERM         3   /* Access permission denied */
  SQLITE_ABORT        4   /* Callback routine requested an abort */
  SQLITE_BUSY         5   /* The database file is locked */
  SQLITE_LOCKED       6   /* A table in the database is locked */
  SQLITE_NOMEM        7   /* A malloc() failed */
  SQLITE_READONLY     8   /* Attempt to write a readonly database */
  SQLITE_INTERRUPT    9   /* Operation terminated by sqlite3_interrupt()*/
  SQLITE_IOERR       10   /* Some kind of disk I/O error occurred */
  SQLITE_CORRUPT     11   /* The database disk image is malformed */
  SQLITE_NOTFOUND    12   /* NOT USED. Table or record not found */
  SQLITE_FULL        13   /* Insertion failed because database is full */
  SQLITE_CANTOPEN    14   /* Unable to open the database file */
  SQLITE_PROTOCOL    15   /* NOT USED. Database lock protocol error */
  SQLITE_EMPTY       16   /* Database is empty */
  SQLITE_SCHEMA      17   /* The database schema changed */
  SQLITE_TOOBIG      18   /* String or BLOB exceeds size limit */
  SQLITE_CONSTRAINT  19   /* Abort due to constraint violation */
  SQLITE_MISMATCH    20   /* Data type mismatch */
  SQLITE_MISUSE      21   /* Library used incorrectly */
  SQLITE_NOLFS       22   /* Uses OS features not supported on host */
  SQLITE_AUTH        23   /* Authorization denied */
  SQLITE_FORMAT      24   /* Auxiliary database format error */
  SQLITE_RANGE       25   /* 2nd parameter to sqlite3_bind out of range */
  SQLITE_NOTADB      26   /* File opened that is not a database file */

New error codes may be added in future versions of SQLite. Note that
the SQLite names of the error codes are not exported by the Sql3
module.

Advanced Features
=================

Sql3's advanced features include the ability to implement SQL
functions in Pure, convenient access to the SQLite C interface and
custom binding types.

Custom SQL Functions
--------------------

An extremely powerful (albeit complex) feature of the SQLite C
interface is the ability to add new SQL scalar or aggregate
functions. The new functions can be used in SQL statements the in same
way as SQLites's prepackaged functions. Sql3 hides the complexity and
seamlessly integrates all of this functionality, :), into Pure via
:func:`create_function`. This function is used to register both scalar SQL
functions and aggregate SQL functions with SQlite.

Scalar SQL Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a custom SQL scalar function to SQLite by passing a single
Pure function to :func:`create_function`.

.. function:: create_function dbp::db_ptr name::string nargs::int pure_fun

   registers a new SQL scalar function of ``nargs`` arguments that can be
   called, as ``name``, in SQL statements prepared with respect to ``dbp``, a
   db_ptr. When the SQL function is called in a SQL statement, control is
   passed to ``pure_fun``, a function written in Pure. If ``nargs`` is
   ``(-1)``, the SQL function ``name`` is variadic, and the arguments will be
   passed to ``pure_fun`` as a single list.

Note that :func:`create_function` can also register aggregate functions (see
`Aggregate SQL Functions`_).

Here is an example of a scalar function that takes two parameters. Note
that any kind of Pure "function" can be passed here; local functions,
global functions, lambdas or partial applications all work. ::

  > create_function dbp::dbp "p_fn" 2 plus with plus x y = x + y; end;

  > let sp4 = prep dbp "cii:" 
  >           "select p_fn('Hi ',name), age, p_fn(age,10) from RM";

  > exec sp4 ();
  [["Hi Sam",20,30],["Hi Fred",22,32]]

Here is an example of a variadic function::

  > create_function dbp "p_qm" (-1) quasimodo with
  >   quasimodo xs = "quasimodo: "+join ":" [str x | x=xs];
  > end;

If the SQL function takes no arguments, the corresponding Pure
function must, for technical reasons in Pure, take a single dummy
argument. E.g., ::

  > create_function dbp "p_count" 0 counter with
  >   counter () = put r (get r+1);
  > end when r = ref 0 end;

Here is how ``count`` and ``quasimodo`` might be used::

  > let sp5 = prep dbp "ic:" "select p_count(), p_qm(name,age) from RM";

  > exec sp5 ();
  [[1,"quasimodo: \"Sam\":20"],[2,"quasimodo: \"Fred\":22"]]

  > exec sp5 ();
  [[3,"quasimodo: \"Sam\":20"],[4,"quasimodo: \"Fred\":22"]]

Multiple SQL functions can be registered with the same name if they
have differing numbers of arguments. Built-in SQL functions may be
overloaded or replaced by new application-defined functions.

Generally, a custom function is permitted to call other Sql3 and
native SQLite C interface functions. However, such calls must not
close the database connection nor finalize or reset the prepared
statement in which the function is running.

Aggregate SQL Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use :func:`create_function` to register an aggregate SQL function
with SQLite by passing a triple consisting of two Pure functions and a
start value, in lieu of a single Pure function.

.. function:: create_function dbp::db_ptr name::string nargs::int (step,final,start)

   registers a new SQL aggregate function of ``nargs`` arguments that can be
   called, as ``name`` in SQL statements prepared with respect to ``dbp``, a
   db_ptr.  ``step`` and ``final`` are curried Pure functions and ``start`` is
   the initial value for the aggregation. The ``step`` function is called
   repeatedly to accumulate values from the database, starting from the given
   ``start`` value, and finally the ``final`` function is applied to the
   accumulated result.

Note that for a single-argument step function, this works exactly as
if the functions were invoked as "``final (foldl step start values)``",
where ``values`` is the list of aggregated values from the database. ::

  > create_function dbp "p_avg" 1 (step,final,(0,0.0)) with
  >   step (n,a) x = n+1, a+x;
  >   final (n,a) = a/n;
  > end;

  > let sp6 = prep dbp "id:" "select count(name), p_avg(age) from RM";

  > exec sp6 ();
  [[2,21.0]]


Accessing the Rest of SQLite's C Interface
------------------------------------------

The db_ptrs returned by :func:`open` and stmt_ptrs returned by :func:`prep`
are sentry guarded versions of the actual pointers to the data base
connection objects and prepared statement objects returned by their
corresponding native C interface functions ``sqlite3_open_v2`` and
``sqlite3_prepare_v2``.  This makes it easy to call almost any
external function in SQLite's C interface directly, passing it the
same db_ptr or stmt_ptr that is passed to Sql3's functions, such as
:func:`prep` or :func:`exec`.

For example, you can override SQLite's default behavior with respect
to a busy database as follows::

  > extern int sqlite3_busy_timeout(sqlite3*, int);

  > sqlite3_busy_timeout dbp 10;

This sets a busy handler that will "sleep and retry" multiple times
until at least 10 milliseconds of sleeping have accumulated.  Calling
this routine with an argument less than or equal to zero turns off all
busy handlers.

Another example is to query the number of database rows that were
changed, inserted or deleted by the most recently completed SQL
statement executed on a given database connection::

  > extern int sqlite3_changes(sqlite3*);

  > exec sp1 ("Harvey",30);

  > sqlite3_changes dbp;
  1

As a final example, in this case using a stmt_ptr, you can determine
name assigned to a column in a result using ``sqlite3_column_name``::

  > extern char *sqlite3_column_name(sqlite3_stmt*, int);
 
  > exec sp2 29;
  [["Harvey",30]]

  > sqlite3_column_name sp2 1;
  "age"

In order to call a native C function you must first make it accessible
using an extern statement.

Please note also that directly calling a function provided by the
SQLite C interface can be dangerous, as is the case with any call from
Pure code to an external C function.  Sql3 users should be especially
careful in this regard because using a db_ptr or a stmt_ptr in calls
to certain native C interface functions, including in particular
``sqlite3_close`` and ``sqlite3_finalize``, will corrupt data held by
the db_ptr or stmt_ptr, leading to undefined behavior. The reason for
this restriction is that Sql3 uses sentries to insure that the
resources associated with a db_ptr or a stmt_ptr are automatically
finalized by SQLite when they go out of scope. In addition, the
sentries carry internal information used by Sql3 for other purposes.


Custom Binding Types for Prepared Statements
--------------------------------------------

You can add your own binding types for preparing and executing
prepared statements by specifying a third argument to :func:`open`.  The
third argument must be a list of "hash rocket pairs" in which the left
side is a character for the custom binding type and the right side is
a list with three members. The second and third members of the list
are functions that map objects from the new type to one of the Sql3
core types and back, respectively. The first member of the list is the
character for the Sql3 core types referenced by the mapping functions.

The file sql3_user_bind_types.pure in the examples subdirectory shows
how this might be done for a couple of user defined types. The example
script deals with dates and certain Pure expressions as bigints and
native Pure expressions, while the database stores these as utf-8
text. The following snippets show parts of the script that are
relevant to this discussion::

  const custom_binds = [
    "t"=>["c",day_to_str,str_to_day],
    "s"=>["c",str,eval]
  ];

  d1 = str_to_day "2010-03-22";

  db = open ("abc.db", SQLITE_OPEN, custom_binds); 
  stm1 = prep db "cts" "insert into TC values(?,?,?)";  
  exec stm1 ["Manny", d1, s_expr];
  stm3a = sql3::prep db "t:" "select t_date from TC";
  stm3b = sql3::prep db "c:" "select t_date from TC";

Executing stm3a and stm3b from the interpreter shows that TC's date
field is stored as a string, but returned to the Pure script as a
bigint. ::

  > sql3::exec stm3a ());
  [[14691L]]

  > sql3::exec stm3b ());
  [["2010-03-22"]]

The character designating the custom type must not be one of the
letters used to designate Sql3 core binding types.

Threading Modes
===============

SQLite supports three different threading modes:

1. Single-thread. In this mode, all mutexes are disabled and SQLite
   is unsafe to use in more than a single thread at once. 

2. Multi-thread. In this mode, SQLite can be safely used by multiple
   threads provided that no single database connection is used
   simultaneously in two or more threads.

3. Serialized. In serialized mode, SQLite can be safely used by
   multiple threads with no restriction.

SQLite can be compiled with or without support for multithreading and
the default is to support it. 

In many cases, single-thread mode might be appropriate if only because
it is measurably faster. This might be the case, for example, if you
are using SQLite as the on-disk file format for a desktop application.

If your version of SQLite was compiled with support for
multithreading, you can switch to single-thread mode at runtime by calling
sqlite3_config() with the verb SQLITE_CONFIG_SINGLETHREAD.

If you must use threads, it is anticipated that Sql3 probably will not
impose an additional burden. Hopefully, you will be fine if you apply
the same precautions to a db_ptr or stmt_ptr that you would apply to
the underlying sqlite* and sqlite_stmt*s if you were not using
Sql3. It is strongly advised however that you look at the underlying
Sql3 code to verify that this will work. Since everything that is
imposed between the raw pointers returned by the SQlite interface and
the corresponding db_ptr and stmt_ptrs is written in Pure, it should
be relatively easy to determine how Sql3 and your multithreading
strategy will interact. See `Is SQLite threadsafe?`_ , `Opening A New
Database Connection`_ and `Test To See If The Library Is Threadsafe`_.
