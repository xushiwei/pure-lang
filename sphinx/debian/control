Description: Functional programming language based on term rewriting
 Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term
 rewriting. It offers equational definitions with pattern matching, full
 symbolic rewriting capabilities, dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation,
 lexical closures, built-in list and matrix support and an easy-to-use C
 interface. The interpreter uses LLVM as a backend to JIT-compile Pure
 programs to fast native code.
