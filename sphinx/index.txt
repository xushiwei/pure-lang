This manual collects all of Pure's online documentation: :doc:`pure` which
covers the Pure language and the operation of the Pure interpreter; the
:doc:`purelib` which describes the standard library modules included in the
distribution of the Pure interpreter; all available documentation for the
various `addon modules`_ which can be downloaded as separate packages from the
Pure website; and an appendix with :doc:`installation instructions<install>`
and additional information for :doc:`Windows users<windows>`.

Most of the Pure documentation is distributed under the |FDL|_. The authors of
the current edition are listed below. (This just lists the primary section
authors in alphabetical order; please check the different parts of this manual
for additional authorship and licensing information.)

* Albert Gr√§f (:doc:`pure`; :doc:`purelib`; various addon manuals)

* Rob Hubbard (:doc:`pure-rational`)

* Kay-Uwe Kirstein (:doc:`pure-gplot`)

* Eddie Rucker (:doc:`pure-csv`; :doc:`pure-gsl`)

* Jiri Spitz (:doc:`pure-glpk`)

* Peter Summerland (:doc:`pure-sql3`, :doc:`pure-stlvec`)

The Pure programming system is free and open source software. The interpreter
runtime, the standard library and most of the addon modules are distributed
under the |LGPL|_ or the 3-clause |BSDL|_ which allow for commercial
applications. Some parts of the system also use the |GPL|_ (typically because
they interface to other GPL'ed software such as Gnumeric, GSL and
Octave). Details about authorship and license conditions can be found in the
sources or in the various manual sections.

For more information, discussions, feedback, questions, suggestions
etc. please see:

   Pure on Windows
   ---------------

   If you're reading this then you're looking at the html help for Pure. The
   following Windows-specific information is available:

   * :doc:`windows`
   * :doc:`purepad`

   Please note that, although the documentation listed below includes *all*
   addon modules which are available for Pure, only a subset of the addon
   modules actually come bundled with the Windows Pure package. Most basic
   extensions are included in the package; at the time of this writing, these
   are: :doc:`pure-csv <pure-csv>`, :doc:`pure-doc <pure-doc>`,
   :doc:`pure-fastcgi <pure-fastcgi>`, :doc:`pure-ffi <pure-ffi>`,
   :doc:`pure-gen <pure-gen>`, :doc:`pure-glpk <pure-glpk>`, :doc:`pure-gsl
   <pure-gsl>`, :doc:`pure-mpfr <pure-mpfr>`, :doc:`pure-odbc <pure-odbc>`,
   :doc:`pure-readline <pure-readline>`, :doc:`pure-sockets <pure-sockets>`,
   :doc:`pure-sql3 <pure-sql3>`, :doc:`pure-stlvec <pure-stlvec>` and
   :doc:`pure-xml <pure-xml>`. Other modules are available as separate
   packages, please check the Addons_ page on the wiki for details.

   .. _Addons: http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/wiki/Addons

   If one of the modules is not currently available, this doesn't mean that it
   can't be ported to Windows; it just means that noone has yet bothered to do
   so. Very few of the distributed Pure modules are truly Unix- or
   Mac-specific (the :pure:mod:`posix` module is one notable example). Feel
   free to ask on the Pure mailing list about modules that you'd like to see
   ported and/or included in the Windows package.

   Index
   -----

   .. We'd like to use the standard :ref:`modindex` target below, but this is
      apparently hardwirded to 'py-modindex'. :(
