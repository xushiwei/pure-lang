This manual contains all of Pure's online documentation: the Pure Manual which
covers the Pure language and the operation of the Pure interpreter; the Pure
Library Manual which describes the standard library modules included in the
distribution of the Pure interpreter; and all available documentation for the
various addon modules which can be downloaded as separate packages from the
`Pure website`_.

Most of the Pure documentation is distributed under the |FDL|_. Please check
the different parts of this manual for additional authorship and licensing
information.

The Pure programming system is free and open source software. The interpreter
runtime, the standard library and most of the addon modules are distributed
under the |LGPL|_ or the 3-clause |BSDL|_ which allow for commercial
applications. Some parts of the system also use the |GPL|_ (typically because
they interface to other GPL'ed software such as Gnumeric, GSL and
Octave). Details about authorship and license conditions can be found in the
sources or in the various manual sections.

etc. please see:
