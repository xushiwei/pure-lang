/* Gnumeric function descriptions. These are optional, but needed if you want
   to tell Gnumeric about the parameters the function is to be invoked with,
   and/or the help text to be displayed for the function. See below for some
   examples.

   To describe a given function to Gnumeric, you define gnm_info "<name>"
   (where <name> is the name of the function) as a pair with the following
   elements:

   - The first element, a string, gives the signature of the function. E.g.,
     "f" denotes a function taking a single float parameter, "fs" a function
     taking a float and a string argument (in that order), etc. Optional
     parameters can be indicated using '|', as in "ff|s" (two non-optional
     floats, followed by an optional string). See the Gnumeric/Pure
     documentation for a complete list of the supported parameter types.

   - The second element is a list of hash pairs key=>text which together make
     up the help text shown in Gnumeric's f(x) dialog. You should at least
     specify the function name along with a short synopsis here, e.g.
     GNM_FUNC_HELP_NAME => "frob:the frob function". Parameter descriptions
     take the form GNM_FUNC_HELP_ARG => "x:integer". There are a number of
     other useful elements, see the Gnumeric/Pure documentation for details.

   Both the signature and the function description are optional. The signature
   defaults to a variadic function which takes any number of parameters of any
   type, and the description defaults to some boilerplate text which says that
   the function hasn't been documented yet.

   Note that if no signature is given, then the function accepts any number of
   parameters of any type, so your function definition must be prepared to
   handle that. In that case, or if there are optional parameters, the
   function becomes variadic and the (optional) parameters are passed as a
   Pure list (in addition to the non-optional parameters). */

/* The function descriptions are a bit unwieldy, so it's convenient to
   construct them using this little helper function. */
