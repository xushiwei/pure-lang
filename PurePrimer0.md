This is a series of tutorials intended for people with some programming experience in languages such as FORTRAN, C, C++, or Python, but not familiar with functional programming, symbolic computation, or term rewriting.

It is recommended to read all the tutorials in the order given, and to try the example code in the PURE interpreter. These tutorials are intended not as a complete exposition of the PURE language but as a hands-on introduction to the main features and concepts of the language. While working through the tutorials, you will find it useful to read the official manuals (the language and the library manual) where all the details are spelled out.
