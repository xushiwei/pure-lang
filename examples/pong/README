The game of Pong, written in Pure.

NOTE: Currently the cursor keys don't work for moving the paddle, use Keypad 8
and 2 instead (NumLock must be on for that to work). There's also an alternate
keybinding (J = up, N = down) which can be configured at the beginning of the
Pure script, along with a few other defaults.

The script requires Pure (>= 0.44), Pure-Tk, Tcl/Tk and Gnocl. Run 'make' to
compile the script.

Enjoy. :)
