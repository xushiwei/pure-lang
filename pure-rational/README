.. Note: If you're wondering about the funny formatting, this README
   simultaneously serves to generate the documentation for this module
   in a variety of formats, using the docutils text formatting system
   (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/).

This module contains a Pure port of Q+Q Rob Hubbard's rational number library
for the Q programming language (see
<http://q-lang.sourceforge.net/addons.html>). This package contains
``ratutils.pure``, a collection of utility functions for rational numbers, and
``rat_interval.pure``, a module for doing interval arithmetic needed by
``ratutils.pure``. These modules are designed to work with the ``math.pure``
module (part of the standard Pure library), which contains the definition of the
``rational`` type and implements the basic rational arithmetic.

Installation
============

Run ``make install`` (as root) to install it in the Pure library directory. This
requires GNU make, and of course you need to have Pure installed. Pure has to
be built with support for the GNU Multiprecision Library (GMP) to use rational
numbers.

``make install`` tries to guess your Pure installation directory. If it gets
this wrong, you can install using ``make install prefix=/usr`` which sets the
installation prefix. Please see the Makefile for details.

Introduction
===============

The Rational Module
-------------------

The module defines a type ``rational`` for Albert Graef’s Pure programming
language (<http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/>). The module is compatible with
Pure version 0.43 (onwards).

The Files and the Default Prelude
---------------------------------

The implementation of the ``rational`` type and associated utilities is
distributed across various files.

``math.pure`` and Other Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file ``math.pure`` defines the type, its constructors and ‘deconstructors’
and basic arithmetical and mathematical operators and functions. This is
part of the standard Pure library. A few definitions associated with
``rationals``
are defined in the appropriate file in the default prelude. For example: the
type tests are contained in ``primitives.pure``.

It is also possible to create rational complex numbers (in addition to
'double' complex numbers and integral or Gaussian complex numbers). That is
``rational`` plays nicely with ``complex``, as provided by Albert Graef’s
complex.q in
the default prelude. This is discussed further in §12.

``ratutils.pure``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional ‘Rational utilities’, not included in the default prelude, are
defined in ratutils.q. The functions include further arithmetical and
mathematical operators and functions, continued fraction support, approximation
routines and string formatting and evaluation. Functions that require ratutils.q
to be explicitly included are indicated like this (U).

The Rational utilities include some 'rational complex number' functions.

``rat_interval.pure``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amongst the Rational utilities are some functions that return a rational
interval. The file ``rat_interval.pure`` is a partial implementation of interval
arithmetic, and is not included in the default prelude. Intervals are discussed
further in §9.1.

Notation
--------

Throughout this document, the parameters q, q0, q1,. . . usually denote
``rationals`` (∈ **Q**), parameters z,. . . usually denote integers (∈ **Z**;
``integers``), r,. . . usually denote real numbers (∈ **R**; ``reals``), c,. . .
usually denote complex numbers (∈ **C**), n,. . . usually denote parameters of
any numeric type, v ,. . . usually denote parameters of any interval type, and
x,. . . usually denote parameters of any type.

The ``reals`` are not just the ``doubles``, but include ``rationals`` and
``integers``. The term
'rational' usually refers to a rational number ∈ **Q** ⊃ **Z**, or an
expression of type ``rational`` or ``integer``.

Functions that require ``ratutils.pure`` to be explicitly included are indicated
like this (U).

Acknowledgements
----------------

Thank you to Dr Albert Graef for helpful feedback on the Q language and for
answering my many questions. Albert performed the organisational work, splitting
my original main source file for partial inclusion in the default prelude, and
provided some of the ‘architectural’ functions required for smooth and
consistent integration with his Q system.

Thanks to various members of the Q users mailing list
(<https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/q-langusers>) for the feedback
and suggestions.

The ``rational`` Type
=====================

Constructors
------------

``rationals`` are constructed with the function rational. 

:rational (z1, z2):
  given a pair of integers (z1, z2), this returns the ``rational`` equivalent to
  the fraction z1/z2. This is the inverse (up to  equivalence) of ``num_den``
  (see §2.2).

**Example 1** Constructing a fraction::

  > rational (44, 14);
  22%7
  >

:rational z:
  given an integer z, this returns the ``rational`` equivalent to the
  ``integer`` z.

**Example 2** Converting from an ``integer``::

  > rational 3;
  3%1
  >

:(%) n1 n2:
  is a ``rational``-aware division function, which may be used as a constructor
  (for ``integers`` n1 and n2). This is described in §3.2.

‘Deconstructors’
------------------

A rational number is in simplest form if the numerator and denominator are
coprime (i.e. do not have a factor in common) and the denominator is positive
(and, specifically, non-zero). Sometimes the term ‘irreducible’ is used for a
rational in simplest form. This is a property of the representation of the
rational number and not of the number itself.

:num q:
  given a ``rational`` or ``integer`` q, returns the ‘(signed) simplest
  numerator’, i.e.  the numerator of the normalised form of q.

:den q:
  given a ``rational`` or ``integer`` q, returns the ‘(positive) simplest
  denominator’,  i.e. the denominator of the normalised form of q.

:num den q:
  given a ``rational`` or ``integer`` q, returns a pair (n, d) containing the
  (signed) simplest numerator n and the (positive) simplest denominator d. This
  is the inverse (up to equivalence) of rational as defined on integer pairs
  (see §2.1).

**Example 3** Using num den to obtain a representation in simplest form::

  > let q = (44%(-14));
  > num q;
  -22
  > den q;
  7
  > num_den q;
  (-22,7)
  > num_den 3;
  (3,1)
  > num_den (-3);
  (-3,1)
  >

Together, num and den are a pair of 'decomposition' operators, and num den is
also a decomposition operator. There are others (see §10). The integer and
fraction function (see §6.2) may be used in conjunction with num den to
decompose a ``rational`` into integer, numerator and denominator parts.

Type and Value Tests
--------------------

The functions isrational and isratval and other rational variants are new for
``rationals`` and the standard functions isexact and isinexact are extended for
``rationals``.

A value is 'exact', or of an exact type, if it is of a type that is able to
represent the values returned by arithmetical operations exactly; in a sense, it
is ‘closed’ under arithmetical operations. Otherwise, a value is ‘inexact’.
Inexact types are able to store some values only approximately.

``double`` is not an exact type. The results of some operations on some values
that are stored exactly, can’t be stored exactly. (Furthermore, ``doubles`` are
intended to represent real numbers; no irrational number (∈ **R** \\ **Q**) can
be stored exactly as a ``double``; even some rational (∈ **Q**) numbers are not
stored exactly.)

``rational`` is an exact type. All rational numbers (subject to available
resources, of course) are stored exactly. The results of the arithmetical
operations on ``rationals`` are ``rationals`` represented exactly. Beware that
the standard isintval and isratval may return true even if the value is of
``double`` type. However, these functions may be combined with isexact.

:exactp x:
  returns whether x has an exact value.

:inexactp x:
  returns whether x has an inexact value.

:rationalp x:
  returns whether x is of type ``rational``.

:ratvalp x:
  returns whether x has a rational value.

**Example 4** Rational value tests::

  > let l = [9, 9%1, 9%2, 4.5, sqrt 2, 1+i, inf, nan];
  > map exactp l;
  [1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]
  > map inexactp l
  [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]
  > map rationalp l;
  [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]
  > map ratvalp l;
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
  > map (\x -> (exactp x && ratvalp x)) l // "has exact rational value"
  [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]
  > map intvalp l // for comparison
  [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
  > map (\x -> (exactp x && intvalp x)) l // "has exact integer value"
  [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
  >

See §12 for details about rational complex numbers, and §12.2 for details of
their type and value tests.

Internal Representation
-----------------------

It is not appropriate to give details of the internal representation of rational
numbers as implemented by this module. That is subject to change.

The module makes no *guarantee* as to whether the internal representation is in
simplest form, how the sign is handled, nor what components are stored (integer
part, sign, numerator and denominator of fraction part,. . .).

The representation is private, therefore you can not operate on rationals except
through the public interface. However, it is useful to be able to understand
responses given by the module when debugging.

See, for example, §2.2 for details of a public interface function providing a
representation with guaranteed properties.

Arithmetic
==========

Operators
---------

The standard arithmetic operators (+), (−) and (*) are overloaded to have at
least one ``rational`` operand. If both operands are ``rational`` then the
result is ``rational``. If one operand is ``integer``, then the result is
``rational``. If one operand is ``double``, then the result is ``double``.

The operators (/) and (%) are overloaded for division on at least one
``rational`` operand. The value returned by (/) is always ``inexact`` (in the
sense of §2.4). The value returned by (%) is ``exact`` (if it exists).

The standard function ``pow`` is overloaded to have a ``rational`` left
operand. If ``pow`` is passed ``integer`` operands where the right operand is
negative, then a ``rational`` is returned. The right operand should be an
``integer``; negative values are permitted (because q\ :sup:`−z` =
1/q\ :sup:`z`). It is not overloaded to also have a ``rational`` right operand
because such values are not generally rational
(e.g. q\ :sup:`1/n` = \ :sup:`n`\√q).

The standard arithmetic operator (^) is also overloaded, but produces a
``double`` value (as always).

The values of ``pow 0 0`` and ``0^0`` (with ``integer`` or ``rational`` zeroes)
are left undefined.

**Example 5** Arithmetic::

  > 5%7 + 2%3;
  29%21
  > str_mixed ans;
  "1+8/21"
  > 1 + 2%3;
  5%3
  > ans + 1.0;
  2.66666666666667
  > 3%8 - 1%3;
  1%24
  > (11%10) ^ 3;
  1.331
  > pow (11%10) 3;
  1331%1000
  > pow 3 5;
  243
  > pow 3 (-5);
  1%243
  >

(The function ``str_mixed`` is described in §14.1.)

Beware that (/) on ``integers`` will not produce a ``rational`` result.

**Example 6** Division::

  > 44/14;
  3.14285714285714
  > 44%14;
  22%7
  > str_mixed ans;
  "3+1/7"

(The function ``str_mixed`` is described in §14.1.)

More on Division
----------------

There is a ``rational``-aware divide operator on the numeric types:

:n1 % n2:
  returns the quotient (∈ **Q**) of n1 and n2. If n1 and n2 are ``rational`` or
  ``integer`` then the result is ``rational``. This operator has the precedence
  of division (/).

**Example 7** Using % like a constructor::

  > 44 % 14;
  22%7
  > 2 + 3%8; // "2 3/8"
  19%8
  > str_mixed ans;
  "2+3/8"
  >

(The function ``str_mixed`` is described in §14.1.)

:reciprocal n:
  returns the reciprocal of n: 1/n.

**Example 8** Reciprocal::

  > reciprocal (22%7);
  7%22
  >

The following division functions are parameterised by a rounding mode
``roundfun``. The available rounding modes are described in §6.1.

:divide roundfun n d:
  for ``rationals`` n and d returns a pair (q, r) of 'quotient' and 'remainder'
  where q is an ``integer`` and r is a ``rational`` such that \|r\| < \|d\| (or
  better) and n = q * d + r. Further conditions may hold, depending on the
  chosen rounding mode ``roundfun`` (see §6.1).
  If ``roundfun`` = floor then 0 ≤ r < d.
  If ``roundfun`` = ceil then −d < r ≤ 0.
  If ``roundfun`` = trunc then \|r\| < \|d\| and sgn r ∈ {0, sgn d}.
  If ``roundfun`` = round, ``roundfun`` = round_zero_bias or ``roundfun`` =
  round_unbiassed then \|r\| ≤ d/2.

:quotient roundfun nN d:
  returns just the quotient as produced by divide roundfun n d.

:modulus roundfun n d:
  returns just the remainder as produced by divide roundfun n d.

:q1 div q2:
  (overload of the built-in div) q1 and q2 may be ``rational`` or ``integer``.
  Returns an ``integer``.

:q1 mod q2:
  (overload of the built-in mod) q1 and q2 may be ``rational`` or ``integer``.
  Returns a ``rational``. If q = q1 div q2 and r = q1 mod q2 then
  q1 = q * q2 + q, q ∈ **Z**, \|r\| < \|q2\| and sgn r ∈ {0, sgn q2}.

Relations — Equality and Inequality Tests
-----------------------------------------

The standard arithmetic operators (=), (<>), (<), (<=), (>), (>=) are overloaded
to have at least one ``rational`` operand. The other operand may be
``rational``, ``integer`` or ``double``.

**Example 9** Inequality::

  > 3%8 < 1%3;
  false
  >

Comparison Function
-------------------

:cmp n1 n2:
  is the ‘comparison’ (or ‘compare’) function, and returns sgn (n1 − n2); that
  is, it returns −1 if n1 < n2, 0 if n1 = n2, and +1 if n1 > n2.

**Example 10** Compare::

  > cmp (3%8) (1%3);
  1
  >

Mathematical Functions
======================

Most mathematical functions, including the elementary functions (sin, sin\
:sup:`−1`, sinh, sinh\ :sup:`−1`, cos,. . . , exp, ln,. . . ), are not closed on
the set of rational numbers. That is, most mathematical functions do not yield a
rational number in general when applied to a rational number. Therefore the
elementary functions are not defined for ``rationals``. To apply these
functions, first apply a cast to ``double``, or compose the function with a
cast.

Absolute Value and Sign
-----------------------

The standard ``abs`` and ``sgn`` functions are overloaded for ``rationals``.

:abs q:
  returns absolute value, or magnitude, \|q\| of q; abs q = \|q\| = q × sgn q
  (see  below).

:sgn q:
  returns the sign of q as an ``integer``; returns −1 if q < 0, 0 if q = 0, +1
  if q > 0.

Together, these functions satisfy the property ∀q • (sgn q) * (abs q) = q (i.e.
∀q • (sgn q) * \|q\| = q). Thus these provide a pair of ‘decomposition’
operators; there are others (see §10).

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The standard functions ``gcd`` and ``lcm`` are overloaded for ``rationals``, and
mixtures of ``integer`` and ``rational``.

:gcd n1 n2:
  The GCD is also known as the Highest Common Factor (HCF). The GCD of rationals
  q1 and q2 is the largest (therefore positive) rational f such that f divides
  into both q1 and q2 exactly, i.e. an integral number of times. This is not
  defined for n1 and n2 both zero. For integral q1 and q2, this definition
  coincides with the usual definition of GCD for integers.

**Example 11** With two ``rationals``::

  > let a = 7%12;
  > let b = 21%32;
  > let f = gcd a b;
  > f;
  7%96
  > a % f;
  8%1
  > b % f;
  9%1
  >

**Example 12** With a ``rational`` and an ``integer``::

  > let f = gcd (6%5) 4;
  > f;
  2%5
  > (6%5) % f;
  3%1
  > 4 % f;
  10%1
  >

**Example 13** With integral ``rationals`` and with ``integers``:

  > gcd (rational 18) (rational 24);
  6%1
  > gcd 18 24;
  6
  >

**Example 14** The behaviour with negative numbers::

  > gcd (rational (-18)) (rational 24);
  6%1
  > gcd (rational 18) (rational (-24));
  6%1
  > gcd (rational (-18)) (rational (-24));
  6%1
  >

:lcm n1 n2:
  The LCM of rationals q1 and q2 is the smallest positive rational m such that
  both q1 and q2 divide m exactly. This is not defined for n1 and n2 both zero.
  For integral q1 and q2, this definition coincides with the usual definition
  of LCM for integers.

**Example 15** With two ``rationals``::

  > let a = 7%12;
  > let bB = 21%32;
  > let m = lcm a b;
  > m;
  21%4
  > m % a;
  9%1
  > m % b;
  8%1
  >

**Example 16** With a ``rational`` and an ``integer``::

  > let m = lcm (6%5) 4;
  > m;
  12%1
  > m % (6%5);
  10%1
  >

**Example 17** The behaviour with negative numbers::

  > lcm (rational (-18)) (rational 24);
  72%1
  > lcm (rational 18) (rational (-24));
  72%1
  > lcm (rational (-18)) (rational (-24));
  72%1
  >

Together, the GCD and LCM have the following property when applied to two
numbers: (gcd q1 q2) * (lcm q1 q2) = \|q1 * q2\|.

Extrema (Minima and Maxima)
---------------------------

The standard ``min`` and ``max`` functions work with ``rational`` values.

**Example 18** Maximum:

  > max (3%8) (1%3);
  3%8
  >

Special ``rational`` Functions
==============================

Complexity
----------

The 'complexity' (or 'complicatedness') of a ``rational`` is a measure of the
greatness of its simplest (positive) denominator.

The complexity of a number is not itself made available, but various functions
and operators are provided to allow complexities to be compared. Generally, it
does not make sense to operate directly on complexity values.

The complexity functions in this section may be applied to ``integers`` (the
least complex), ``rationals``, or ``reals`` (``doubles``; the most complex).

Functions concerning 'complexity' are named with 'cplx', whereas functions
concerning 'complex numbers' (see §12) are named with 'comp'.

Complexity Relations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:n1 eq_cplx n2:
  "[is] equally complex [to]" — returns 1 if n1 and n2 are equally complex;
  returns 0 otherwise. Equal complexity is not the same a equality; n1 and n2
  are equally complex if their simplest denominators are equal. Equal complexity
  forms an equivalence relation on ``rationals``.

**Example 19** Complexity equality test::

  > (1%3) eq_cplx (100%3);
  1
  > (1%4) eq_cplx (1%5);
  0
  > (3%3) eq_cplx (1%3); // LHS is not in simplest form
  0
  >

:n1 not_eq_cplx n2"
  "not equally complex" — returns 0 if n1 and n2 are equally complex; returns 1
  otherwise.

:n1 less_cplx n2"
  "[is] less complex [than]" (or "simpler") — returns 1 if n1 is strictly less
  complex than n2; returns false otherwise. This forms a partial strict ordering
  on ``rationals``.

**Example 20** Complexity inequality test::

  > (1%3) less_cplx (100%3);
  0
  > (1%4) less_cplx (1%5);
  1
  > (3%3) less_cplx (1%3); // LHS is not in simplest form
  1
  >

:n1 less_eq_cplx n2:
  "less or equally complex" (or "not more complex") — returns 1 if n1 is less
  complex than or equally complex to n2; returns 0 otherwise. This forms a
  partial non-strict ordering on ``rationals``.

:n1 more_cplx n2:
  "[is] more complex [than]" — returns 1 if n1 is strictly more complex than n2;
  returns 0 otherwise. This forms a partial strict ordering on ``rationals``.

:n1 more_eq_cplx n2:
  "more or equally complex" (or "not less complex") — returns 1 if n1 is more
  complex than or equally complex to n2; returns false otherwise. This forms a
  partial non-strict ordering on ``rationals``.

Complexity Comparison Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:cmp_complexity n1 n2:
  is the 'complexity comparison' function, and returns the sign of the
  difference in complexity; that is, it returns −1 if n1 is less complex than
  n2, 0 if n1 and n2 are equally complex (but not necessarily equal), and +1 if
  n1 is more complex than n2.

**Example 21** Complexity comparison::

  > cmp_complexity (1%3) (100%3);
  0
  > cmp_complexity (1%4) (1%5);
  -1
  > cmp_complexity (3%3) (1%3); // LHS is not in simplest form
  -1
  >

Complexity Extrema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:least_cplx n1 n2:
  returns the least complex of n1 and n2; if they’re equally complex, n1 is
  returned.

**Example 22** Complexity selection::

  > least_cplx (100%3) (1%3);
  100%3
  > least_cplx (1%5) (1%4);
  1%4
  > least_cplx (1%3) (3%3); // second argument not in simplest form
  1%1
  >

:most_cplx n1 n2:
  returns the most complex of n1 and n2; if they’re equally complex, n1 is
  returned.

Other Complexity Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:complexity_rel n1 op n2:
  returns "complexity-of n1" compared by operator op to the “complexity-of n2”.
  This is equivalent to prefix complexity rel op n1 n2 (below), but is the more
  readable form.

**Example 23** Complexity relations::

  > complexity_rel (1%3) (==) (100%3);
  1
  > complexity_rel (1%4) (<=) (1%5);
  1
  > complexity_rel (1%4) (>) (1%5);
  0
  >

:prefix_complexity_rel op n1 n2:
  returns the same as complexity_rel n1 op n2, but this form is more convenient
  for currying.

Mediants and Farey Sequences
----------------------------

:mediant q1 q2:
  returns the canonical mediant of the rationals q1 and q2, a form of
  (nonarithmetic) average on rationals. The mediant of the representations
  n1/d1 = q1 and n2/d2 = q2, where d1 and d2 must be positive, is defined as
  (n1 + n2)/(d1 + d2). A mediant of the rationals q1 and q2 is a mediant of some
  representation of each of q1 and q2. That is, the mediant is dependent upon
  the representations and therefore is not well-defined as a function on pairs
  of rationals. The canonical mediant always assumes the simplest
  representation, and therefore is well-defined as a function on pairs of
  rationals.

  By the phrase “the mediant” (as opposed to just “a mediant”) we
  always mean “the canonical mediant”.

  If q1 < q2, then any mediant q is always such that q1 < q < q2.

  The (canonical) mediant has some special properties. If  q1 and q2 are
  integers, then the mediant is the arithmetic mean. If q1 and q2  are unit
  fractions (reciprocals of integers), then the mediant is the harmonic  mean.
  The mediant of q and 1/q is ±1, (which happens to be a geometric mean   with
  the correct sign, although this is a somewhat uninteresting and  degenerate
  case).

**Example 24** Mediants::

  > mediant (1%4) (3%10);
  2%7
  > mediant 3 7; // both ``integers``
  5%1
  > mediant 3 8; // both ``integers`` again
  11%2
  > mediant (1%3) (1%7); // both unit fractions
  1%5
  > mediant (1%3) (1%8); // both unit fractions again
  2%11
  > mediant (-10) (-1%10);
  -1%1
  >

:farey -k:
  for an ``integer`` k, farey returns the ordered list containing the order-k
  Farey sequence, which is the ordered list of all rational numbers between 0
  and 1 inclusive with (simplest) denominator at most k.

**Example 25** A Farey sequence::

  > map str_mixed (farey 6);
  ["0","1/6","1/5","1/4","1/3","2/5","1/2","3/5","2/3","3/4","4/5","5/6","1"]
  >

(The function ``str_mixed`` is described in §14.1.)

Farey sequences and mediants are closely related. Three rationals q1 < q2 < q3
are consecutive members of a Farey sequence if and only if q2 is the mediant of
q1 and q3. If rationals q1 = n1/d1 < q2 = n2/d2 are consecutive members of a
Farey sequence, then n2d1 − n1d2 = 1.

``rational`` Type Simplification
--------------------------------

:rat_simplify q:
  returns q with ``rationals`` simplified to ``integers``, if possible.

**Q** ! **Z** — Rounding
========================

Rounding to Integer
-------------------

Some of these are new functions, and some are overloads of standard functions.
The behaviour of the overloads is consistent with that of the standard
functions.

:floor q:
  (overload of standard function) returns q rounded downwards, i.e. towards −1,
  to an ``integer``, usually denoted bQc.

:ceil q:
  (overload of standard function) returns q rounded upwards, i.e. towards +1, to
  an ``integer``, usually denoted dQe. 

:trunc q:
  (overload of standard function) returns q truncated, i.e. rounded towards 0,
  to an ``integer``.

:round q:
  (overload of standard function) returns q ‘rounded off’, i.e. rounded to the
  nearest ``integer``, with ‘half-integers’ (values that are an integer plus a
  half) rounded away from zero.

:round_zero_bias q:
  (new function) returns q ‘rounded off’, i.e. rounded to the nearest
  ``integer``, but with ‘half-integers’ rounded towards zero.

:round_unbiased q:
  (new function) returns q rounded to the nearest ``integer``, with
  ‘half-integers’ rounded to the nearest even ``integer``.

**Example 27** Illustration of the different rounding modes::

  > let l = while (<= 3) (+(1%2)) (- rational 3)
  > map double l; // (just to show the values in a familiar format)
  [-3.0,-2.5,-2.0,-1.5,-1.0,-0.5,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5,3.0]
  > map floor l;
  [-3,-3,-2,-2,-1,-1,0,0,1,1,2,2,3]
  > map ceil l;
  [-3,-2,-2,-1,-1,0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3]
  > map trunc l;
  [-3,-2,-2,-1,-1,0,0,0,1,1,2,2,3]
  > map round l;
  [-3,-3,-2,-2,-1,-1,0,1,1,2,2,3,3]
  > map round_zero_bias l;
  [-3,-2,-2,-1,-1,0,0,0,1,1,2,2,3]
  > map round_unbiased l;
  [-3,-2,-2,-2,-1,0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3]
  >

(The function ``double`` is described in §8.)

Integer and Fraction Parts
--------------------------

:integer_and_fraction roundfun q:
  returns a pair (z, f) where z is the ‘integer part’ as an ``integer``, f is
  the ‘fraction part’ as a ``rational``, where the rounding operations are
  performed using rounding mode ``roundfun`` (see §6.1).

**Example 28** Integer and fraction parts with the different rounding modes::

  > let nc = -22%7;
  > integer_and_fraction floor nc;
  (-4,6%7)
  > integer_and_fraction trunc nc;
  (-3,-1%7)
  > integer_and_fraction round nc;
  (-3,-1%7)
  >

It is always the case that z and f have the property that q = z + f. However,
the remaining properties depend upon the choice of ``roundfun``.
Thus this provides a ‘decomposition’ operator; there are others (see §10).
If ``roundfun`` = floor then 0 ≤ f < 1. If Round = ceil then −1 < f ≤ 0.
If ``roundfun`` = trunc then \|f\| < 1 and sgn f ∈ {0, sgn q}.
If ``roundfun`` = round, ``roundfun`` = round_zero_bias or ``roundfun`` =
round_unbiassed then \|f\| ≤ 1/2.

:fraction roundfun q:
  returns just the ‘fraction part’ as a ``rational``, where the rounding
  operations are performed using ``roundfun``. The corresponding function
  ‘integer’ is not provided, as integer ``roundfun`` q would be just
  ``roundfun`` q. The integer and fraction function (probably with trunc or
  floor rounding mode) may be used in conjunction with num den (see §2.2) to
  decompose a ``rational`` into integer, numerator and denominator parts.

:int q:
  overloads the built-in int and returns the ‘integer part’ of q consistent with
  the built-in.

:frac q:
  overloads the built-in frac and returns the ‘fraction part’ of q consistent
  with the built-in.

**Example 29** Standard integer and fraction parts::

  > let nc = -22%7;
  > int nc;
  -3.0
  > frac nc;
  -0.142857142857143
  >

Rounding to Multiples
=====================

:round_to_multiple roundfun multOf q:
  returns q rounded to an integer multiple of a non-zero value multOf, using
  ``roundfun`` as the rounding mode (see §6.1). Note that it is the multiple
  that is rounded in the prescribed way, and not the final result, which may
  make a difference in the case that multOf is negative. If that is not the
  desired behaviour, pass this function the absolute value of multOf rather than
  multOf. Similar comments apply to the following functions.

:floor_multiple multOf q:
  returns q rounded to a downwards integer multiple of multOf.

:ceil_multiple multOf q:
  returns q rounded to an upwards integer multiple of multOf.

:trunc_multiple multOf q:
  returns q rounded towards zero to an integer multiple of multOf.

:round_multiple multOf q:
  returns q rounded towards the nearest integer multiple of multOf, with
  half-integer multiples rounded away from 0.

:round_multiple_zero_bias multOf q:
  returns q rounded towards the nearest integer multiple of multOf, with
  half-integer multiples rounded towards 0.

:round_multiple_unbiased multOf q:
  returns q rounded towards the nearest integer multiple of multOf, with
  half-integer multiples rounded to an even multiple.

**Example 30** Round to multiple::

  > let l = [34.9, 35, 35%1, 35.0, 35.1];
  > map double l; // (just to show the values in a familiar format)
  [34.9,35.0,35.0,35.0,35.1]
  > map (floor_multiple 10) l;
  [30,30,30,30,30]
  > map (ceil_multiple 10) l;
  [40,40,40,40,40]
  > map (trunc_multiple 10) l;
  [30,30,30,30,30]
  > map (round_multiple 10) l;
  [30,40,40,40,40]
  > map (round_multiple_zero_bias 10) l;
  [30,30,30,30,40]
  > map (round_multiple_unbiased 10) l;
  [30,40,40,40,40]

(The function ``double`` is described in §8.)

The round multiple functions may be used to find a fixed denominator
approximation of a number. (The simplest denominator may actually be a proper
factor of the chosen value.) To approximate for a bounded (rather than
particular) denominator, use rational approx max den instead (see §9.3).

**Example 31** Finding the nearest q = n/d value to 1/e ≈ 0.368 where d = 1000
(actually, where d\|1000)::

  > let co_E = exp (-1);
  co_E;
  0.367879441171442
  > round_multiple (1%1000) co_E;
  46%125
  > 1000 * ans;
  368%1
  >

**Example 32** Finding the nearest q = n/d value to 1/ɸ ≈ 0.618 where d = 3\
:sup:`5` = 243 (actually, where d\|243)::

  > let co_Phi = (sqrt 5 - 1) / 2;
  > round_multiple (1%243) co_Phi;
  50%81
  >

Other methods for obtaining a ``rational`` approximation of a number are
described in §9

**Q** → **R** — Conversion / Casting
====================================

:double q:
  (overload of built-in) returns a ``double`` having a value as close as
  possible to q. (Overflow, underflow and loss of accuracy are potential
  problems. ``rationals`` that are too absolutely large or too absolutely small
  may overflow or underflow; some ``rationals`` can not be represented exactly
  as a ``double``.)

**R** → **Q** — Approximation
=============================

This section describes functions that approximate a number (usually a
``double``) by a ``rational``. See §7 for approximation of a number by a
``rational`` with a fixed denominator. See §17 for approximation by a
``rational`` of a string representation of a real number.

Intervals
---------

Some of the approximation functions return an ``interval``. The file
``rat_interval.pure`` is a basic implementation of interval arithmetic, and is
not included in the default prelude. It is not intended to provide a complete
implementation of interval arithmetic. The notions of ‘open’ and ‘closed’
intervals are not distinguished. Infinite and half-infinite intervals are not
specifically provided. Some operations and functions may be missing. The most
likely functions to be used are simply the ‘deconstructors’; see §9.1.1.

``interval`` Constructors and 'Deconstructors'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intervals are constructed with the function interval.

:interval (n1, n2):
  given a pair of numbers (z1 <= z2), this returns the ``interval`` z1..z2. This
  is the inverse of ``lo_up``.

**Example 33** Constructing an interval::

  > let v = interval (3, 8);
  > v;
  rational::Ivl 3 8
  >

:lower v:
  returns the infimum (roughly, minimum) of v.

:upper v:
  returns the supremum (roughly, maximum) of v.

:lo_up v:
  returns a pair (l, u) containing the lower l and upper u extrema of the
  interval v. This is the inverse of interval as defined on number pairs.

**Example 34** Deconstructing an interval:

  > lower v;
  3
  > upper v;
  8
  > lo_up v;
  (3,8)
  >

``interval`` Type Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:exactp v:
  returns whether an interval v has exact extrema.

:inexactp v:
  returns whether an interval v has an inexact extremum.

:intervalp x:
  returns whether x is of type ``interval``.

:interval_valp x:
  returns whether x has an interval value.

:ratinterval_valp x:
  returns whether x has an interval value with rational extrema.

:intinterval_valp x:
  returns whether x has an interval value with integral extrema.


**Example 35** ``interval`` value tests::

  > let l = [interval(0,1), interval(0,1%1), interval(0,3%2), interval(0,1.5)];
  > map exactp l;
  [1,1,1,0]
  > map inexactp l
  [0,0,0,1]
  > map intervalp l;
  [1,1,1,1]
  > map interval_valp l;
  [1,1,1,1,]
  > map ratinterval_valp l;
  [1,1,1,1]
  > map intinterval_valp l;
  [1,1,0,0]

``interval`` Arithmetic Operators and Relations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard arithmetic operators (+), (−), (*), (/) and (%) are overloaded for
``intervals``. The divide operators (/) and (%) do not produce a result if the
right operand is an interval containing 0.

**Example 36** Some intervals::

  > let a = interval (11, 19);
  > let b = interval (16, 24);
  > let c = interval (21, 29);
  > let d = interval (23, 27);
  >

**Example 37** ``interval`` arithmetic::

  > let p = interval (0, 1);
  > let s = interval (-1, 1);
  > a + b;
  rational::Ivl 27 43
  > a - b;
  rational::Ivl -13 3
  > a * b;
  rational::Ivl 176 456
  > p * 2;
  rational::Ivl 0 2
  > (-2) * p;
  rational::Ivl -2 0
  > -c;
  rational::Ivl -29 -21
  > s * a;
  rational::Ivl -19 19
  > a % 2;
  rational::Ivl (11%2) (19%2)
  > a / 2;
  rational::Ivl 5.5 9.5
  > reciprocal a;
  rational::Ivl (1%19) (1%11)
  > 2 % a;
  rational::Ivl (2%19) (2%11)
  > a % b
  rational::Ivl 11%24 19%16
  > a % a; // notice that the intervals are mutually independent here
  rational::Ivl (11%19) (19%11)
  >

There are also some relations defined for ``intervals``. The standard relations
(==) and (~=) are overloaded.

However, rather than overloading (<), (<=), (>), (>=), which could be used for
either ordering or containment with some ambiguity, the module defines
``(before)``, ``(within)``, and so on. ‘Strictness’ refers to the properties at
the end-points.

:v1 before v2:
  returns whether v1 is entirely before v2.

:v1 strictly_before v2:
  returns whether v1 is strictly entirely before v2.

:v1 after v2:
  returns whether v1 is entirely after v2.

:v1 strictly_after v2:
  returns whether v1 is strictly entirely after v2.

:v1 within v2:
  returns whether v1 is entirely within v2; i.e. whether v1 is subinterval of
  v2.

:v1 strictly_within v2:
  returns whether v1 is strictly entirely within v2; i.e. whether v1 is proper
  subinterval of v2.

:v1 without v2:
  returns whether v1 entirely contains v2; i.e. whether v1 is superinterval of
  v2. 'Without' is used in the sense of outside or around.

:v1 strictly_without v2:
  returns whether v1 strictly entirely contains v2; i.e. whether v1 is proper
  superinterval of v2.

:v1 disjoint v2:
  returns whether v1 and v2 are entirely disjoint.

:v strictly_disjoint v2:
  returns whether v1 and v2 are entirely strictly disjoint.

**Example 38** ``interval`` relations::
  
  > a == b;
  0
  > a == a;
  1
  > a before b;
  0
  > a before c;
  1
  > c before a;
  0
  > a disjoint b;
  0
  > c disjoint a;
  1
  > a within b;
  0
  > a within c;
  0
  > d within c;
  1
  > c within d;
  0
  > a strictly_within a;
  0
  > a within a;
  1
  >

(The symbols a through d were defined in example 36.)

These may also be used with a simple (``real``) value, and in particular to test
membership.

**Example 39** Membership::

  > 10 within a;
  0
  > 11 within a;
  1
  > 11.0 within a;
  1
  > 12 within a;
  1
  > 12.0 within a;
  1
  > 10 strictly_within a;
  0
  > 11 strictly_within a;
  0
  > (11%1) strictly_within a;
  0
  > 12 strictly_within a;
  1
  > (12%1) strictly_within a;
  1
  >

(The symbol a was defined in example 36.)

``interval`` Maths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some standard functions are overloaded for intervals; some new functions are
provided.

:abs v:
  returns the interval representing the range of (x) as x varies over v.

**Example 40** Absolute interval::

  > abs (interval (1, 5));
  rational::Ivl 1 5
  > abs (interval (-1, 5));
  rational::Ivl 0 5
  > abs (interval (-5, -1));
  rational::Ivl 1 5
  >

:sgn v:
  returns the interval representing the range of sgn(x) as x varies over v.

:#v:
  returns the length of an interval.

**Example 41** Absolute interval::

  > #d;
  4

(The symbol d was defined in example 36.)

:rational_approx_epsilon ε r:
  Find the least complex (see §5.1.3) ``rational`` approximation to r (usually a
  ``double``) that is ε-close. That is find the q with the smallest possible

  >

:rational_approxs_epsilon ε r:
  Produce a list of ever better ``rational`` approximations to r (usually a
  ``double``) that is eventually ε-close. (ε > 0.)

  [3%1,25%8,47%15,69%22,91%29,113%36,135%43,157%50,179%57,201%64,223%71,245%78,
  267%85,289%92,311%99,333%106]
  >

**Example 45** ``rational`` approximations to the golden ratio ɸ; these
approximations are always reverse consecutive Fibonacci numbers (from f1: 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, . . .):

  > rational_approxs_epsilon .0001 phi;
  [1%1,3%2,8%5,21%13,55%34,144%89]
  >

(The symbol phi was defined in example 43.)

:rational_interval_epsilon ε r:
  Find the least complex (see §5.1.3) ``rational`` interval containing r
  (usually a ``double``) that is ε-small. That is find the least complex (see
  §5.1.3) q1 ≤ q2 such that r ∈ [q1, q2] and q2 − q1 ≤ ε. (ε > 0.)

**Example 46** ``rational`` interval surrounding π::

  > let i_Pi = rational_interval_epsilon .01 pi;

(The functions lower and upper are described in §9.1.1.)

  > rational_interval_epsilon .001 phi
  rational::Ivl (55%34) (89%55)
  > #ans;
  1%1870

(The symbol Phi was defined in example 43. The function # is described in
§9.1.4.)

Best Approximation with Bounded Denominator
-------------------------------------------

:rational_approx_max_den maxDen r:
  Find the closest ``rational`` approximation to r (usually a ``double``) that
  has a denominator no greater than maxDen. (maxDen > 0).

  rational::Ivl (987%610) (1597%987)
  >

(The symbol phi was defined in example 43.)

To approximate for a particular (rather than bounded) denominator, use round to
multiple instead (see §7).

Decomposition
=============

There is more than one way to ‘decompose’ a rational number into its
‘components’. It might be split into an integer and a fraction part — see §6.2;
or sign and absolute value — see §4.1; or numerator and denominator — see §2.2.

Continued Fractions
===================

Introduction
------------

In "pure-rational", a continued fraction 
a\ :sub:`0` + (1 / (a\ :sub:`1` + (1/ (a\ :sub:`2` + · · · + 1 / a\ :sub:`n`))))
where ∀i > 0 • a\ :sub:`i` ≠ 0, is represented by [a\ :sub:`0`, a\ :sub:`1`,
a\ :sub:`2`, . . . , a\ :sub:`n`].

A ‘simple’ continued fraction is one in which ∀i • a\ :sub:`i` ∈ **Z** and ∀i >
0 • a\ :sub:`i` > 0.

Simple continued fractions for rationals are not quite unique since [a\
:sub:`0`, a\ :sub:`1`, . . . , a\ :sub:`n`, 1] = [a\ :sub:`0`, a\ :sub:`1`, . .
. , a\ :sub:`n+1`]. We will refer to these as the 'non-standard' and 'standard'
forms, respectively. The following functions return the standard form.

Generating Continued Fractions

12 ``rational`` ``complex`` Numbers
Q provides various types of number, including ``integers`` (Z), ``doubles`` (R,
roughly), ``complex`` numbers (C)
and Gaussian integers (Z[i]); the rational.q module adds ``rationals`` (Q) and
rational complex numbers
(Q[i]).

12.1 ``rational`` ``complex`` Constructors and ‘Deconstructors’
``complex`` numbers can have rational parts.
Example 59 Forming a rational complex.
  > 1 + i * (1%2)
1%1+:1%2
  > _ * _
3%4+:1%1
And rational numbers can be given complex parts.
Example 60 ``complex`` rationals and complicated rationals.
  > (1+2*i) % (3+4*i)
11%25+:2%25
  > _ * (3+4*i)
1%1+:2%1
  > ((4%1)*i) % 2
0%1+:2%1
  > ((4%1)*i) % (1%2)
0%1+:8%1
  > ((4%1)*i) % (1+(1%2)*i)
8%5+:16%5
  > _ * (1+(1%2)*i)
0%1+:4%1
  > ((4%1)*i) / (1+(1%2)*i)
1.6+:3.2
The various parts of a complex rational may be deconstructed using combinations
of num and den and
the standard functions re and im.
Thus, taking real and imaginary parts first, a rational complex number may be
considered to be
Xn
Xd
+ Yn
Yd
 i
with Xn,Xd, Yn, Yd 2 Z.
A rational complex number may also be decomposed into its ‘numerator’ and
‘denominator’, where these
are both integral complex numbers, or ‘Gaussian integers’, and the denominator
is a minimal choice in
some sense.
One way to do this is so that the denominator is the minimum positive integer.
The denominator is a
complex number with zero imaginary part.
Thus, taking numerator and denominator parts first, a rational complex number
may be considered to
be
Nx + Ny  i
d + 0  i
with Nx,Ny,d 2 Z.
25
Another way to do this is so that the denominator is a Gaussian integer with
minimal absolute value.
Thus, taking numerator and denominator parts first, a rational complex number
may be considered to
be
Nx + Ny  i
Dx + Dy  i
with Nx,Ny,Dx,Dy 2 Z.
The Dx,Dy are not unique, but can be chosen such that Dx > 0 and either |Dy| <
Dx or Dy = Dx > 0.
num den nat
(U)
C — given a ``complex`` ``rational`` or ``integer`` C, returns a pair (n,d)
containing an integral
complex (Gaussian integral) numerator n, and the smallest natural (i.e. positive
integral real)
complex denominator d, i.e. a complex number where <(d) 2 Z, <(d) > 0, =(d) = 0;
i.e. the
numerator and denominator of one ‘normalised’ form of C.
This is an inverse (up to equivalence) of rational as defined on integral
complex pairs (see §2.1).
num den gauss
(U)
C — given a ``complex`` ``rational`` or ``integer`` C, returns a pair (n,d)
containing an integral
complex (Gaussian integral) numerator n, and an absolutely smallest integral
complex denominator
d chosen s.t. <(d),=(d) 2 Z, <(d) > 0, and either |=(d)| < <(d) or =(d) = <(d) >
0; i.e.
the numerator and denominator of another ‘normalised’ form of C.
This is an inverse (up to equivalence) of rational as defined on integral
complex pairs (see §2.1).
num den
(U)
C — synonymous with num den gauss.
This is an inverse (up to equivalence) of rational as defined on integer pairs
(see §2.1).
num
(U)
C — given a ``complex`` ``rational`` or ``integer`` C, returns just the
numerator of the normalised form of C
given by num den C.
den
(U)
C — given a ``complex`` ``rational`` or ``integer`` C, returns just the
denominator of the normalised
form of C given by num den C.

12.2 ``rational`` ``complex`` Type and Value Tests
Beware that isintcompval and isratcompval may return true even if the value is
of ``complex`` type
with ``double`` parts. However, these functions may be combined with isexact.
iscomplex X — standard function; returns whether X is of ``complex`` type.
iscompval X — standard function; returns whether X has a ``complex`` value (2 C
= R[i]).
isratcompval
(U)
X — returns whether X has a rational complex value (2 Q[i]).
isintcompval
(U)
X — returns whether X has an integral complex value (2 Z[i]), i.e. a Gaussian
integer
value.
Example 62 ``rational`` complex number value tests.
  > let L = [9, 9%1, 9%2, 4.5, sqrt 2, 1+i, 1%2+i, 0.5+i, inf, nan]
  > map isexact L

See §2.4 for some details of rational type and value tests.
12.3 ``rational`` ``complex`` Arithmetic Operators and Relations
The standard arithmetic operators (+), (−), (), (/), (%), (), (=) and (<>) are
overloaded to have at
least one complex and/or rational operand, but (<), (<=), (>), (>=) are not, as
complex numbers are
unordered.
27
Example 63 ``rational`` complex arithmetic.
  > let W = 1%2+3%4*i; let Z = 5%6+7%8*i
  > W + Z; W % Z
4%3+:13%8
618%841+:108%841
  > W / Z
0.734839476813318+:0.128418549346017
  > W ^ 2
-0.3125+:0.75
  > W = Z
false
  > W = W
true
12.4 ``rational`` ``complex`` Maths
The standard functions re and im work with rational complex numbers (see §12.1).
The standard functions polar, abs and arg work with rational complex numbers,
but the results are
inexact.
Example 64 ``rational`` complex maths.
  > polar (1%2) (1%2)
0.438791280945186+:0.239712769302102
  > abs (4%2 + 3%2*i)
2.5
  > arg (-1%1)
3.14159265358979
There are some additional useful functions for calculating with rational complex
numbers and more
general mathematical values.
norm gauss
(U)
C — returns the Gaussian norm ||C|| of any ``complex`` (or ``real``) number C;
this is the
square of the absolute value, and is returned as an (exact) ``integer``.
div mod gauss
(U)
n d — performs Gaussian integer division, returning (q,r) where q is a (not
always
unique) quotient, and r is a (not always unique) remainder. q and r are such
that n = qd+r
and ||r|| < ||d|| (equivalently, |r| < |d|).
n div gauss
(U)
d — returns just a quotient from Gaussian integer division as produced by
div mod gauss n d.
n mod gauss
(U)
d — returns just a remainder from Gaussian integer division as produced by
div mod gauss n d.
gcd gauss
(U)
C1 C2 — returns a GCD G of the Gaussian integers C1,C2. This is chosen so that
s.t.
<(G) > 0, and either |=(G)| < <(G) or =(G) = <(G) > 0;
euclid gcd
(U)
Zero Mod X Y — returns a (non-unique) GCD calculated by performing the Euclidean
algorithm on the values X and Y (of any type) where Zero is a predicate for
equality to 0, and
Mod is a binary modulus (remainder) function.
euclid alg
(U)
Zero Div X Y — returns (G, A,B) where the G is a (non-unique) GCD and A,B are
(arbitrary, non-unique) values such that AX+BY = G calculated by performing
the generalised
Euclidean algorithm on the values X and Y (of any type) where Zero is a
predicate for equality
to 0, and Div is a binary quotient function.

12.5 ``rational`` ``complex`` Type Simplification
comp simplify
(U)
C — returns q with ``complex`` numbers simplified to ``reals``, if possible.
ratcomp simplify
(U)
C — returns q with ``rationals`` simplified to ``integers``, and ``complex``
numbers simplified
to ``reals``, if possible.
Example 66 ``rational`` complex number type simplification.
  > let L = [9+i, 9%1+i, 9%2+i, 4.5+i, 9%1+0*i, 9%2+0*i, 4.5+0.0*i]; L

See §5.3 for some details of rational type simplification.
13 String Formatting and Evaluation
13.1 The Naming of the String Conversion Functions
There are several families of functions for converting between strings and
``rationals``.
29
The functions that convert from ``rationals`` to strings have names based on
that of the standard function
str. The str * functions convert to a formatted string, and depend on a ‘format
structure’ parameter
(see §13.2). The strs * functions convert to a tuple of string fragments.
The functions that convert from strings to ``rationals`` have names based on
that of the standard function
val. The val * functions convert from a formatted string, and depend on a format
structure parameter.
The sval * functions convert from a tuple of string fragments.
There are also join * and split * functions to join string fragments into
formatted strings, and to split
formatted strings into string fragments, respectively; these depend on a format
structure parameter.
These functions are not always invertible, because some of the functions reduce
an error term to just a
sign, e.g. str real approx dp may round a value. Thus sometimes the join * and
split * pairs, and
the str * and val * pairs are not quite mutual inverses.
This is illustrated in Figure 4; dotted lined indicate a possibly imperfect
mapping.

13.2 Internationalisation and Format Structures
Many of the string formatting functions in the following sections are
parameterised by a ‘format structure’.
Throughout this document, the formal parameter for the format structure will be
Fmt. This is simply a
map from some string ‘codes’ to functions as follows. The functions are mostly
from strings to a string,
or from a string to a tuple of strings.
"sm": a function mapping a sign and an unsigned mantissa (or integer) strings to
a signed mantissa (or
integer) string.
"se": a function mapping a sign and an unsigned exponent string to a signed
exponent string.
"-s": a function mapping a signed number string to a pair containing a sign and
the unsigned number
string.
"gi": a function mapping an integer representing the group size and an integer
string to a grouped integer
string
"gf": a function mapping an integer representing the group size and a
fraction-part string to a grouped
fraction-part string
"-g": a function mapping a grouped number string to an ungrouped number string
"zi": a function mapping an integer number string to a number string. The input
string representing
zero integer part is "", which should be mapped to the desired representation of
zero. All other
number strings should be returned unaltered.
"zf": a function mapping a fraction-part number string to a number string. The
input string representing
zero fraction part is "", which should be mapped to the desired representation
of zero. All other
number strings should be returned unaltered.
"ir": a function mapping initial and recurring parts of a fraction part to the
desired format.
30
"-ir": a function mapping a formatted fraction part to the component initial and
recurring parts.
"if": a function mapping an integer string and fraction part string to the
radix-point formatted string
"-if": a function mapping a radix-point formatted string to the component
integer fraction part strings
"me": a function mapping a mantissa string and exponent string to the formatted
exponential string
"-me": a function mapping a formatted exponential string to the component
mantissa and exponent strings
"e": a function mapping an ‘error’ number (not string) and a number string to a
formatted number
string indicating the sign of the error.
"-e": a function mapping a formatted number string indicating the sign of the
error to the component
‘error’ string (not number) and number strings.
Depending upon the format structure, some parameters of some of the functions
taking a format structure
may have no effect. For example, an IntGroup parameter specifying the size of
the integer digit groups
will have no effect if the integer group separator is the empty string.
create format
(U)
Options is a function that provides an easy way to prepare a ‘format structure’
from
the simpler ‘options structure’.
The options structure is another dictionary, but from more descriptive strings
to a string or tuple
of strings.
For example, format uk
(U) is generated from options uk
(U) as follows:
public const var options_uk;
let options_uk =
dict [
("sign", ("-","","")), //alternative: ("-"," ","+")
("exponent sign", ("-","","")), //alternative: ("-","","+")
("group separator", ","), //might be " " or "." or "’" elsewhere
("zero", "0"),
("radix point", "."), //might be "," elsewhere
("fraction group separator", ","),
("fraction zero", "0"), //alternative: ""
("recur brackets", ("[","...]")),
("exponent", "*10^"), //(poor) alternative: "e"
("error sign", ("-","","+")),
("error brackets", ("(",")")),
];
public const var format_uk;
let format_uk = create_format options_uk;
The exponent string need not depend on the radix, as the numerals for the number
radix in that
radix are always "10".
Beware of using "e" or "E" as an exponent string as these have the potential of
being treated as
digits in, e.g., hexadecimal.
Format structures do not have to be generated via create format; they may also
be constructed directly.
13.3 Digit Grouping
Some functions take Group parameters. A value of 0 means “don’t group”.
31
13.4 Radices
The functions that produce a decimal expansion take a Radix argument.
The fraction parts are expanded in that radix (or ‘base’), in addition to the
integer parts. The parameter
Radix is not restricted to the usual {2, 8, 10, 16}, but may be any ``integer``
from 2 to 36; the numerals (‘digits’)
are chosen from [“0”, . . . , “9”, “A”, . . . , “Z”]. The letter-digits are
always upper case.
The functions do not attach a prefix (such as "0x" for hexadecimal) to the
resulting string.
13.5 Error Terms
Some functions return a value including an ‘error’ term (in a tuple) or sign (at
the end of a string). Such
an error is represents what the next digit would be as a fraction of the radix.
Example 67 Error term in the tuple of string ‘fragments’.
  > strs_real_approx_sf 10 floor 3 (234567%100000)
("+","2","34",567%1000)
  > strs_real_approx_sf 10 ceil 3 (234567%100000)
("+","2","35",-433%1000)
(The function strs real approx sf is described in §16.1.2.)
In strings, only the sign of the error term is given. A “+” should be read as
“and a bit more”; “-” as
“but a bit less”.
Example 68 Error sign in the string.
  > str_real_approx_sf format_uk 10 0 0 floor 3 (234567%100000)
"2.34(+)"
  > str_real_approx_sf format_uk 10 0 0 ceil 3 (234567%100000)
"2.35(-)"
(The function str real approx sf is described in §16.1.2.)
14 Q $ Fraction String (“i + n/d”)
14.1 Formatting to Fraction Strings
str vulgar
(U)
q — returns a String representing the ``rational`` (or ``integer``) q in the
form
• “[−]n/d”
str vulgar or int
(U)
q — returns a String representing the ``rational`` (or ``integer``) q in one of
the forms
• “[−]n/d”
• “[−]i”
str mixed
(U)
q — returns a String representing the ``rational`` (or ``integer``) q in one of
the forms
• “i + n/d”
• “−(i + n/d)”
• “[−]n/d”
• “[−]i”
Example 69 The fraction string representations.
32
  > let L = while (<= 3%2) (+(1%2)) (-3%2); L
[-3%2,-1%1,-1%2,0%1,1%2,1%1,3%2]
  > map str_vulgar L
["-3/2","-1/1","-1/2","0/1","1/2","1/1","3/2"]
  > map str_vulgar_or_int L
["-3/2","-1","-1/2","0","1/2","1","3/2"]
  > map str_mixed L
["-(1+1/2)","-1","-1/2","0","1/2","1","1+1/2"]
These might be compared to the behaviour of the standard function str.
str X — returns a String representing the value X.
Example 70 The standard function str.
  > map str L
["-3%2","-1%1","-1%2","0%1","1%2","1%1","3%2"]
14.2 Evaluation of Fraction Strings
val vulgar
(U)
Str — returns a ``rational`` q represented by the String Str in the form
• “[−]n/d”
Such strings can also be evaluated by the val mixed function.
val mixed
(U)
Str — returns a ``rational`` q represented by the String Str
• “i + n/d”
• “−(i + n/d)”
• “[−]n/d” — thus val mixed strictly extends val vulgar
• “[−]i”
Example 71 Evaluating fraction strings.
  > val_vulgar "-22/7"
-22%7
  > val_mixed "1+5/6"
11%6
These might be compared to the behaviour of the standard function val.
val S — evaluates the String S.
Example 72 The standard function val.
  > val "1+5%6"
11%6
  > val "1+5/6"
1.83333333333333
15 Q $ Recurring Numeral Expansion String (“I.FR”)
See §13.2 for information about the formatting structure to be supplied in the
Fmt parameter.
33
15.1 Formatting to Recurring Expansion Strings
str real recur
(U)
Fmt Radix IntGroup q — returns a String (exactly) representing the ``rational``
(or ``integer``) q as base-Radix expansion of one the forms
• “[−]int.frac”
• “[−]int.init frac part[smallest recurring frac part. . . ]”
Note that there is no FracGroup parameter.
Beware that the string returned by this function can be very long. The length of
the recurring part
of such a decimal expansion may be up to one less than the simplest denominator
of q.
Example 73 The recurring radix expansion-type string representations.
  > str_real_recur format_uk 10 3 (4000001%4) // grouped with commas
"1,000,000.25"
  > str_real_recur format_uk 10 0 (4000001%4) // no grouping
"1000000.25"
  > str_real_recur format_uk 10 3 (1000000%3)
"333,333.[3...]"
  > str_real_recur format_uk 10 3 (1000000%7)
"142,857.[142857...]"
  > str_real_recur format_uk 10 3 (-1%700)
"-0.00[142857...]"
  > str_real_recur format_uk 10 3 (127%128)
"0.9921875"
  > str_real_recur format_uk 2 4 (-127%128)
"-0.1111111"
  > str_real_recur format_uk 16 4 (127%128)
"0.FE"
  > str_real_recur format_uk 10 0 (70057%350) // 1%7 + 10001%50
"200.16[285714...]"
The function allows expansion to different radices (bases).
Example 74 The recurring radix expansion in decimal and hexadecimal.
  > str_real_recur format_uk 10 0 (1%100)
"0.01"
  > str_real_recur format_uk 16 0 (1%100)
"0.0[28F5C...]"
Example 75 The recurring radix expansion in duodecimal.
  > str_real_recur format_uk 12 0 (1%100)
"0.0[15343A0B62A68781B059...]"
Note that this bracket notation is not standard in the literature. Usually the
recurring numerals
are indicated by a single dot over the initial and final numerals of the
recurring part, or an overline
over the recurring part. For example 1/70 = 0.0˙14285˙7 = 0.0142857 and 1/3 =
0.˙3 = 0.3.
strs real recur
(U)
Radix q — returns a quadruple of the four strings:
• the sign,
• integer part (which is empty for 0),
• initial fraction part
• and recurring fraction part (either and both of which may be empty).
34
Example 76 The recurring radix expansion in decimal — the fragments.
  > strs_real_recur 10 (100%7)
("+","14","","285714")
  > strs_real_recur 10 (-1%700)
("-","","00","142857")
  > strs_real_recur 10 (70057%350)
("+","200","16","285714")
This function may be used to also, e.g. format the integer part with
comma-separated groupings.
join str real recur
(U)
Fmt IntGroup Sign i FracInit FracRecur —formats the parts in the quadruple
returned by strs real recur to the sort of string as returned by str real recur.
15.2 Evaluation of Recurring Expansion Strings
The str * and val * functions depend on a ‘format structure’ parameter (Fmt)
such as format uk. Conversions
may be performed between ``rationals`` and differently formatted strings if a
suitable alternative
format structure is supplied. See §13.2 for information about formatting
structures.
val real recur
(U)
Fmt Radix Str — returns the ``rational`` q represented by the base-Radix
expansion
String Str of one the forms
• “[−]int.frac”
• “[−]int.init frac part[recurring frac part. . . ]”
Example 77 Conversion from the recurring radix expansion-type string
representations.
  > val_real_recur format_uk 10 "-12.345"
-2469%200
  > val_real_recur format_uk 10 "0.3"
3%10
  > val_real_recur format_uk 10 "0.[3...]"
1%3

16 Q $ Numeral Expansion String (“I.F × 10E”)
See §13.2 for information about the formatting structure to be supplied in the
Fmt parameter.
The exponent string "*10^" need not depend on the radix, as the numerals for the
number radix in that
radix are always "10".
16.1 Formatting to Expansion Strings
16.1.1 Functions for Fixed Decimal Places
str real approx dp
(U)
Fmt Radix IntGroup FracGroup Round DP q — returns a string representing
a numeral expansion approximation of q to DP decimal places, using rounding mode
Round
(see §6.1).
Round is usually round or round unbiased.
(DP may be positive, zero or negative; non-positive DPs may look misleading —
use e.g. scientific
notation instead.)
Example 78 Decimal places.
  > str_real_approx_dp format_uk 10 3 3 round 2 (22%7)
"3.14(+)"
  > str_real_approx_dp format_uk 10 3 3 ceil 2 (22%7)
"3.15(-)"
strs real approx dp
(U)
Radix Round DP q — returns a tuple of strings
• sign
• integer part
• fraction part
representing an expansion to a number of decimal places, together with
• the rounding “error”: a fraction representing the next numerals
Example 79 Decimal places — the fragments.
  > strs_real_approx_dp 10 round 2 (22%7)
("+","3","14",2%7)
  > strs_real_approx_dp 10 ceil 2 (22%7)
("+","3","15",-5%7)
join str real approx
(U)
Fmt IntGroup FracGroup Sign i Frac Err —formats the parts in the quadruple
returned by strs real approx dp or strs real approx sf to the sort of string as
returned by
str real approx dp or str real approx sf.
16.1.2 Functions for Significant Figures
str real approx sf
(U)
Fmt Radix IntGroup FracGroup Round SF q — returns a string representing
a numeral expansion approximation of q to SF significant figures, using rounding
mode Round
(see §6.1).
Round is usually round or round unbiased.
(SF must be positive.)
Example 80 Significant figures.
36
  > str_real_approx_sf format_uk 10 3 3 floor 2 (22%7)
"3.1(+)"
  > str_real_approx_sf format_uk 10 3 3 floor 2 ((-22)%7)
"-3.2(+)"
strs real approx sf
(U)
Radix Round SF q — returns a tuple of strings
• sign,

str real approx sci
(U)
Fmt Radix IntGroup FracGroup Round SF q — returns a string expansion
with a number of significant figures in scientific notation, using rounding mode
Round (see
§6.1).
(SF must be positive; ExpStep is usually 3, Radix is usually 10, Round is
usually round or
round unbiased; str real approx sci is equivalent to str real approx eng (below)
with ExpStep =
1.)
strs real approx sci
(U)
Radix Round SF q — returns a tuple of strings:
• sign of mantissa,
• integer part of mantissa,
• fraction part of mantissa,
• sign of exponent,
• exponent magnitude
representing an expansion to a number of significant figures in scientific
notation together with
• the rounding “error”: a fraction representing the next numerals
str real approx eng
(U)
Fmt ExpStep Radix IntGroup FracGroup Round SF q — returns a string
expansion with a number of significant figures in engineering notation, using
rounding mode Round.
The ExpStep parameter specifies the granularity of the exponent; specifically,
the exponent will
always be divisible by ExpStep.
(SF must be positive; ExpStep is usually 3 and must be positive, Radix is
usually 10, Round is
usually round or round unbiased.)
Example 81 Engineering notation.
  > str_real_approx_eng format_uk 3 10 3 3 round 7 (rational 999950)
"999.950,0*10^3"

Fmt IntGroup FracGroup MantSign MantI MantF rac ExpSign ExpI Err
—formats the parts in the quadruple returned by strs real approx eng or strs
real approx sci
to the sort of string as returned by str real approx eng or str real approx sci.
16.2 Evaluation of Expansion Strings
The str * and val * functions depend on a ‘format structure’ parameter (Fmt)
such as format uk. Conversions
may be performed between ``rationals`` and differently formatted strings if a
suitable alternative
format structure is supplied. See §13.2 for information about formatting
structures.

17 Numeral String ! Q — Approximation
This section describes functions to approximate by a ``rational`` a real number
represented by a string.
See §9 for approximation by a ``rational`` of a ``double``.
The str * and val * functions depend on a ‘format structure’ parameter (Fmt)
such as format uk. Conversions
may be performed between ``rationals`` and differently formatted strings if a
suitable alternative
format structure is supplied. See §13.2 for information about formatting
structures.
