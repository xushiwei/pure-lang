This is a digital audio interface for the Pure programming language. It
currently includes the following modules:

* audio.pure: A PortAudio wrapper which gives you portable access to realtime
  audio input and output on a variety of different host APIs. This uses the
  well-known PortAudio library by Ross Bencina, Phil Burk et al, see
  http://www.portaudio.com/.

* sndfile.pure: Reading and writing audio files in various formats. This is a
  fairly straightforward wrapper for Erik de Castro Lopo's libsndfile library,
  see http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/.

* samplerate.pure: Perform sample rate conversion on audio data. This uses
  another of Erik's excellent libraries, libsamplerate (a.k.a. SRC), see
  http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/.

* realtime.pure: A little utility module which provides access to realtime
  scheduling to Pure programs. You may need this for low-latency realtime
  audio applications.

Documentation still needs to be written, so for the time being please read the
source modules listed above and have a look at the examples provided in the
distribution.

Installation
------------

You need to have libportaudio (v19), libsndfile (1.x) and libsamplerate
(0.1.x) installed on your system. Any fairly recent version of these libraries
should do. For the realtime module you also need a POSIX-compatible threads
library (libpthread); Linux, OSX and other Un*x systems should offer this.
Windows probably needs some work, so by default the realtime module isn't
built on Windows right now.

The Pure wrappers contained in the distribution are for 64 bit POSIX
systems. If you're running a 32 bit system, or Windows, then you should
regenerate them using 'make generate'. This requires the header files
portaudio.h, samplerate.h and sndfile.h (and pure-gen, of course). If you do
this, check the includedir variables defined in the Makefiles, these need to
point to the directories where the corresponding header files are to be found
(the default is /usr/include).

Then just run 'make' to compile the package. If you're lucky and everything
compiles smoothly, you can install with 'sudo make install'.

If you're not so lucky, you can get help on the Pure mailing list, see
http://groups.google.com/group/pure-lang.
