Description: MPFR interface for the Pure programming language
 Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term
 rewriting. This package provides the mpfr module which makes the GNU MPFR
 multiprecision floats available as a new number type in the Pure language, so
 that they work with the other types of Pure numbers in an almost seamless
 fashion.
