# The Pure Programming Language #

<a href='http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/'><img src='http://wiki.pure-lang.googlecode.com/hg/waterdrop.png' align='right' border='0' /></a>

Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term rewriting. It offers equational definitions with pattern matching, full symbolic rewriting capabilities, dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation, lexical closures, built-in list and matrix support and an easy-to-use C interface. The interpreter uses [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) as a backend to JIT-compile Pure programs to fast native code.
