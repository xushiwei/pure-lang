pure-fastcgi: FastCGI module for Pure
=====================================

This module lets you write FastCGI_ scripts with Pure, to be run by web
servers like Apache_. Compared to normal CGI scripts, this has the advantage
that the script keeps running and may process as many requests from the web
server as you like. Most ordinary CGI scripts can be converted to use FastCGI
with minimal changes.

Installation
============

Besides Pure, you'll need to have the FastCGI_ library installed to compile
this module. Also, to run FastCGI scripts, your web server must be configured
accordingly; see the documentation of FastCGI and your web server for details.

Running ``make`` compiles the module, ``make install`` installs it in your
Pure library directory. You might have to adjust the path to the fcgi_stdio.h
header file in fastcgi.c and/or the option to link in the FastCGI library in
the Makefile.

The Makefile tries to guess the host system type and Pure version, and
set up some platform-specific things accordingly. If this doesn't work for
your system then you'll have to edit the Makefile accordingly.

Usage
=====

pure-fastcgi provides the ``accept`` function with which you tell the FastCGI
server that your script is ready to accept another request. It also overrides
a number of standard I/O functions so that they talk to the server instead.
These routines are all in the ``fastcgi`` namespace. In your Pure script, you
can set up a simple loop to process requests as follows::

  #!/usr/local/bin/pure -x

  using fastcgi;
  using namespace fastcgi;

  extern char *getenv(char*);

  main count = main count when
    count = count+1;
    printf "Content-type: text/html\n\n\
  <title>FastCGI Hello! (Pure, fcgi_stdio library)</title>\
  <h1>FastCGI Hello! (Pure, fcgi_stdio library)</h1>\
  Request number %d running on host <i>%s</i>\n"
    (count,getenv "SERVER_NAME");
  end if accept >= 0;

  main 0;

(You might have to adjust the "shebang" in the first line above, so that the
shell finds the Pure interpreter. Also, remember to make the script executable.
If you're worried about startup times, or if your operating system doesn't
support shebangs, then you can also use the Pure interpreter to compile the
script to a native executable instead.)

This script keeps running until ``accept`` returns ``-1`` to indicate that the
script should exit. Each call to ``accept`` blocks until either a request is
available or the FastCGI server detects an error or other kind of termination
condition. As with ordinary CGI, additional information about the request is
available through various environment variables. A list of commonly supported
environment variables and their meaning can be found in `The Common Gateway
Interface`_ specification.

A number of other routines are provided to deal with data filters, finish a
request and set an exit status for a request. These correspond to operations
provided by the FastCGI library, see the FastCGI documentation and the
FCGI_Accept(3), FCGI_StartFilterData(3), FCGI_Finish(3) and
FCGI_SetExitStatus(3) manpages for details. An interface to the FCGI_ToFILE
macro is also available. Note that in Pure these functions are called
``accept``, ``start_filter_data``, ``finish``, ``set_exit_status`` and
``to_file``, respectively, and are all declared in the ``fastcgi`` namespace.
A detailed listing of all routines can be found in the fastcgi.pure module.

To run your FastCGI scripts in a browser, your web server must have the
FastCGI module loaded and must also be set up to execute the scripts. E.g.,
when using Apache, the following configuration file entry will set up a
directory for FastCGI scripts::

  ScriptAlias /fastcgi-bin/ "/srv/www/fastcgi-bin/"
  <Location /fastcgi-bin/>
      Options ExecCGI 
      SetHandler fcgid-script
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
  </Location>

You'll have to put this into http.conf or a similar file provided by your
Apache installation (usually under /etc/apache2), and restart Apache. After
that you can just throw your scripts into the ``fastcgi-bin`` directory to
have them executed when opening an URL like
``http://localhost/fastcgi-bin/myscript`` in the browser.

See the examples subdirectory in the sources for some more examples.
