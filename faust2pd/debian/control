Description: Generate Pd GUI abstractions from Faust programs
 faust2pd is a little utility to generate "graph-on-parent" GUI abstractions
 from programs written in Faust, Grame's functional signal processing
 language. This makes it easier to use Faust signal processing units with
 Miller Puckette's Pure Data (Pd).
