pure-gsl - GNU Scientific Library interface for Pure
======== = === ========== ======= ========= === ====

Building on Pure's GSL matrix support, this module aims to provide a complete
wrapper for the GNU Scientific Library which provides a wide range of
mathematical routines useful for scientific programming, number crunching and
signal processing applications.

This is still work in progress, not much there yet right now. Please check
back again later.
