pure-gsl - GNU Scientific Library interface for Pure
======== = === ========== ======= ========= === ====

Building on Pure's GSL matrix support, this module aims to provide a complete
wrapper for the GNU Scientific Library which provides a wide range of
mathematical routines useful for scientific programming, number crunching and
signal processing applications.

This is still work in progress, only a small part of the interface is finished
right now. Here is a brief summary of the operations which are implemented:

- Matrix-scalar and matrix-matrix arithmetic. This is fairly complete and
  includes matrix multiplication, as well as element-wise exponentiation (^)
  and integer operations (div, mod, bit shifts and bitwise logical operations)
  which aren't actually in the GSL API.

- SVD (singular value decomposition), as well as the corresponding solvers,
  pseudo inverses and left and right matrix division. This is only available
  for real matrices right now, as GSL doesn't implement complex SVD.

Installation instructions: Run 'make' ('make PIC=-fPIC' on x86-64 systems) to
compile the module and 'make install' (as root) to install it in the Pure
library directory. This requires GNU make. And of course you need to have Pure
and GSL installed.

The 'make install' step is only necessary for system-wide installation. 'make'
will try to guess your Pure installation directory, if it gets it wrong, you
can specify the installation prefix as follows: 'make install prefix=/usr'.
Make sure that you get this right, otherwise the Pure interpreter won't be
able to find the installed module.

See the 'examples' folder in the sources for some examples.
