	* run-tests: Exclude some extra preprocessor symbols to make 'make
	check' work with newer gcc versions.

2011-06-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure-gen.pure: Cosmetic change in Pure output code, so that a
	'struct name*' becomes 'name*' in extern declarations, rather than
	just 'void*'. This seems more useful now that Pure cross-checks
	C pointer types.

	* pure-gen.pure (enumtypedefs, defines): We need to keep track of
	enums declared without a proper typedef.

	* ChangeLog started
