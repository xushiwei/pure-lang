<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</a></h1>
<p><em>Scale</em> is a program for rationalizing and visualizing musical scales. The
original version of this program was written in 2001 and documented in the
author's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/Musikinformatik/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a> (pdf file) &quot;Musical scale rationalization: a graph-theoretic
approach&quot;, but isn't available on the web any more. The present version is a
complete rewrite in the <a class="reference external" href="http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/">Pure</a> programming language. Compared to the original
version, it has a nicer GTK+ GUI (using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnocl.org/">Gnocl</a>) and visualization component
(using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a>), and the automatic scale rationalization algorithm has been
simplified quite a bit to make it easier to use. On the other hand, the
present version still lacks the MIDI tuning applet which was part of the
original program. However, the scale program uses the scale file format of
Manuel Op de Coul's very comprehensive <a class="reference external" href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">Scala</a> program, so for the time being,
Scala can be used for tuning your MIDI files.</p>
<p>The scale program generally computes <em>disharmonicities</em> using an additive
measure which assigns basic &quot;indigestibility&quot; values to prime numbers. A
simple example of this approach is Euler's <em>gradus suavitatis</em>, but the scale
program provides various different measures derived from the works of Euler
and the contemporary composer Clarence Barlow. (The notion of &quot;prime
indigestibilities&quot; and the idea of automatic scale rationalization are in fact
due to Barlow.)</p>
<p>The harmonic distance of two rational scale tones x and y is then given by the
disharmonicity of the (rational) interval x/y. If this value is large then the
interval contains many and/or large prime factors and is thus considered
&quot;complex&quot; and &quot;disharmonious&quot;. Conversely, if the value is small then the
interval is considered &quot;harmonious&quot; which means that the two involved scale
tones x and y are closely related to each other.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the resulting notion of <em>harmonic distance</em> is actually a
metric in the mathematical sense, and can thus be used to visualize the
harmonic relationships in a scale. Moreover, harmonic distances also
facilitate the manual or automatic generation of rationalizations of a given
non-rational scale. Please see the author's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/Musikinformatik/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a> for a detailed account on
the theory behind this.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation</a></h1>
<p>You need the following dependencies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/">Pure</a>, including the Pure Tk and Octave modules.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.octave.org/">Octave</a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl/Tk</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnocl.org/">Gnocl</a>.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a>, including the Tcl bindings.</li>
</ul>
<p>You probably need fairly recent versions of all these. Pure 0.44, Octave
3.2.4, Tcl/Tk 8.5 (+ Gnocl 0.9.94g) and VTK 5.4.2 have been tested and are
known to work.</p>
<p>After installing all the dependencies, type <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt> to compile and <tt class="docutils literal">sudo
make install</tt> to install the scale program. (This just copies the scale
program to /usr/local/bin and the html version of this manual to
/usr/local/share/doc. You can specify an alternative installation prefix with
the <tt class="docutils literal">prefix</tt> variable.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="usage">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage</a></h1>
<p>The scale program reads and writes files in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">Scala</a> scale file format.
(The Scala file format is the de facto standard for musical scale data. Please
check the Scala website for details on Scala and its big repository of scale
files.) To open a scale (.scl) file, use the <tt class="docutils literal">Open</tt> button in the main
window, or specify the file on the command line, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
scale b12tone.scl
</pre>
<p>The main window is divided into two panes, a notebook widget with the
<tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Scale</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Metric</tt> tabs in the upper half, and a box with
various entry fields, global parameter values, a strip of buttons and a status
line in the lower half. The status line gives feedback during operations which
may take a while to complete (in particular, when drawing and rationalizing a
scale). The <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> tab displays a 3-dimensional rendering of the scale. The
<tt class="docutils literal">Scale</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Metric</tt> tabs have additional related information about the
scale points and the disharmonicity metric of the scale.</p>
<p>Scales can be loaded and saved with the <tt class="docutils literal">Open</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Save</tt> buttons at the
bottom of the main window, see <a class="reference internal" href="#file-operations">File Operations</a> below for details. If you
load a plain Scala file, you will be prompted if you first want to draw
it. This is also needed to generate some useful information on the <tt class="docutils literal">Scale</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">Metric</tt> tabs, so you should answer <tt class="docutils literal">Yes</tt> there. You can also just
enter a scale in Scala format (ratios as p/q where p and q are positive
integers, cent values as nonnegative floating point values) in the upper entry
field in the lower half of the main window and then click the <tt class="docutils literal">Draw</tt> button
to render the scale. Some already rendered examples are included in the scl
subdirectory in the sources, so have a look at those to get an idea how this
works.</p>
<p>Note that the <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Metric</tt> tabs will only have interesting
information if all scale points are rational; this is required to compute the
disharmonicity metric. In this case the scale display shows an approximation
of the harmonic distances of the scale points in three-dimensional Euclidean
space, computed using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm (also
described in the author's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/Musikinformatik/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a>). The necessary operations to create a
rational scale from any input scale are provided, see <a class="reference internal" href="#rationalizing-a-scale">Rationalizing a Scale</a>
below.</p>
<p>To exit the program, click the <tt class="docutils literal">Quit</tt> button at the right end of the button
strip (equivalently, you can also use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Alt-Q</span></tt> keyboard shortcut), or
just close the main window. The <tt class="docutils literal">About</tt> button in the lower part of the main
window (keyboard shortcut: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Alt-B</span></tt>) shows some useful information about the
program, while the <tt class="docutils literal">Help</tt> button (keyboard shortcut: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Alt-H</span></tt>) displays
this manual in a web browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-operations">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File Operations</a></h1>
<p>The file operations can be found in the button strip at the bottom of the main
window.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">New</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Open</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Save</tt>: Creates a new, loads an existing, or saves the
current scale, respectively. With the latter two commands you are prompted
to enter a scale (.scl) filename.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Revert</tt>: Reverts to the most recently saved version of the loaded scale.
This provides a quick way to revert your changes after editing the scale or
experimenting with different scale rationalizations.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Quit</tt>: Exit the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are generally indicated using underlining in the button
texts. So, e.g., the <tt class="docutils literal">Open</tt> command can be invoked with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Alt-O</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Save</tt>
with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Alt-S</span></tt>, etc.</p>
<p>As of version 0.2, the scale program can also save scales as binary sysex
(.syx) files in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.midi.org/techspecs/midituning.php">MIDI Tuning Standard</a> (MTS) format, so that you can
easily retune any MTS-compatible synthesizer to a scale by just sending the
corresponding sysex file to it. Currently this only works with octave-based
scales which have exactly 13 scale points (including the base tone 1/1 and the
octave 2/1). The written sysex files follow the <em>MIDI Tuning Scale/Octave
Extensions</em>, please check the MTS documentation for details.</p>
<p>To save a scale as a sysex file, simply invoke the <tt class="docutils literal">Save</tt> operation as
usual. When prompted to enter the scale filename, edit the filename so that it
ends in the extension <tt class="docutils literal">.syx</tt>, then press <tt class="docutils literal">Save</tt>. A special dialog will
appear which allows you to choose various MTS format options. Adjust these to
your liking and press <tt class="docutils literal">Save</tt> again (you can also cancel the operation at
this point). The available MTS format options are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Realtime</tt>: If this option is checked, a realtime sysex message will be
written, otherwise a non-realtime message. Note that in either case, the
tuning changes will take effect immediately if the sysex file is sent to an
MTS-capable synthesizer. However, realtime messages will also affect already
sounding notes, whereas non-realtime messages only apply to new notes played
after the message is sent.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Encoding</tt>: This is a combobox which allows you to pick the desired
encoding of the MTS message. MTS octave tunings can be encoded in either
1-byte or 2-byte format, meaning that each tuning offset is represented as
one or two bytes, respectively. This affects both range and precision of the
tuning offsets, please check the MTS documentation for details. Usually it
is a good idea to pick the 2-byte encoding, since it offers a wider range
(-100..+100 ct) and better precision. However, if your synthesizer only
supports the 1-byte encoding, or if you are really concerned about
transmission bandwidth then it may be necessary to choose the 1-byte
encoding instead. (Note that 2-byte messages need roughly twice the size of
1-byte messages; this may affect how quickly the messages are processed,
although this is rarely a problem with modern hardware any more).</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Base</tt>: This spinbox enables you to select the reference tone of the
tuning, given as the index of a scale point in the range 0..11. A value of 0
indicates that the base tone of the scale will be at its nominal tuning
(i.e., at a tuning offset of 0 ct). The spinbox allows you to change this as
needed. Most of the time, you will want to choose the value 9 to have the
9th scale tone (which usually corresponds to the chamber pitch A) at a
tuning offset of 0 ct, so that A4 will be exactly at 440 Hz; this shifts the
other tuning offsets accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, realtime messages and 2-byte encodings are enabled, and the base
tone is set to 9, which should be sensible defaults in most cases.</p>
<p>Note that in order to actually use the resulting sysex files, you need an
MTS-compatible synthesizer. Unfortunately, the MIDI Tuning Standard isn't
supported by many hardware synthesizers, so you'll probably have to use a
software synthesizer instead. A good MTS-compatible software synthesizer is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.fluidsynth.org/">Fluidsynth</a> which uses SoundFonts and has a nice graphical frontend called
<a class="reference external" href="http://qsynth.sourceforge.net">Qsynth</a>. It is available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition, you'll need a program which can read sysex files and transmit
them to the synthesizer. There are many such programs freely available for
different platforms, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.christeck.de/wp/products/simple-sysexxer/">Simple Sysexxer</a> on Linux and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.midiox.com/">Midi-Ox</a> on
Windows. Also, many MIDI sequencing programs have this capability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editing-the-scale">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Editing The Scale</a></h1>
<p>At the bottom of the main window there are two entry fields. The first field
is for the scale itself, while the second one is for a short plain text
description of the scale. You can write anything in the second field (you can
also just leave it empty), but the scale data must follow the Scala
conventions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A quotient in the form <tt class="docutils literal">p/q</tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal">p</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">q</tt> are positive integer
values, denotes an interval by its frequency ratio, e.g.: <tt class="docutils literal">1/1</tt> (unison),
<tt class="docutils literal">3/2</tt> (fifth), <tt class="docutils literal">2/1</tt> (octave), etc.</li>
<li>A nonnegative floating point value such as <tt class="docutils literal">0.0</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">701.955</tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal">1200.0</tt> denotes a Cent value (percent of an equal-tempered semitone).</li>
</ul>
<p>No other values are allowed in this field. Different scale tones are usually
entered in ascending order, starting with the base tone <tt class="docutils literal">1/1</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">0.0</tt>,
with whitespace in between. For instance: <tt class="docutils literal">1/1 100.0 3/2 1200.0</tt>. (Note that
the base tone is implicit in the Scala file format, so it is not actually
stored in scale files. That's why even if you don't enter the base tone it
will be added automatically.)</p>
<p>To the right of the scale entry field there's another control, the &quot;weight
threshold&quot; spinbox which allows you to enter a harmonic distance threshold
used to render the scale graph in the <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> tab, and to determine rational
tuning alternatives in the <tt class="docutils literal">Scale</tt> view. You'll have to adjust this value
accordingly when drawing or rationalizing a scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-graph-view">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Graph View</a></h1>
<p>Once a scale has been entered or loaded, you can draw it by pushing the
<tt class="docutils literal">Draw</tt> button on the <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> tab. This produces a graphical rendering of
the scale. The graphical rendering is also stored in the scale file when you

automatically.</p>
<p>If the scale contains any Cent values, the graphical display is a simple chain
of the scale points in the order in which they are given. If all scale points
are rational, however, then you'll see a proper 3-dimensional rendering of the
scale, called a &quot;harmonicity graph.&quot; The nodes of this graph are the scale
points and the edges represent color-coded harmonic distances between some
pairs of scale points (see below).</p>
<p>Note that the graphical rendering isn't arbitrary, but approximates the
harmonic distances (shown on the <tt class="docutils literal">Metric</tt> tab) between scale points by their
Euclidean distances in the drawing, so that it becomes easy to analyse the
harmonic relationships in the scale. This is achieved using a technique
called &quot;multidimensional scaling&quot; (MDS), see the author's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/Musikinformatik/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a> for details.</p>
<p>The graphical view can be rotated, panned and zoomed with the mouse, so that
you can take a look at the scale from all angles. To these ends, press a mouse
button in the graph window (left for rotation, middle for panning, right for
zooming) and, with the mouse button still pressed, move the mouse cursor in
any direction. Moving the mouse cursor with the left or middle button pressed
rotates or moves the view in the corresponding direction. To zoom in and out,
with the right mouse button pressed move the mouse cursor up and down,
respectively.</p>
<p>The following keyboard commands are recognized in the graphical view:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">r</tt>: Resets the view to the default camera position (horizontal x and
vertical y axis, with positive z coordinates in front).</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">j</tt>: Switches to an alternative &quot;joystick&quot; mode in which you only have to
press the left/right/middle mouse button inside the view to rotate/pan/zoom.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">t</tt>: Switches back to the default &quot;trackball&quot; mode in which you drag the
mouse cursor with the left/right/middle mouse button to rotate/pan/zoom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various controls for the display can be found in the strip at the bottom of
the <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> pane:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Draw</tt>: Updates the scale information and redraws the scale. Progress will
be shown in the progress bar in the main window (to the right of the scale
description field). You can run this as often as you want, e.g., after
editing the scale. Also, note that the MDS algorithm starts from a random
start embedding, so for some scales you might get different renderings when
you redraw the scale.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Axes</tt>: Enables or disables x, y and z axes display in the view.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Labels</tt>: Enables or disables the node label display which shows
information about the scale points in the graph.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Node label type</tt>: A combobox which lets you choose between &quot;Pitch&quot; (show
ratios or cent values; this is the default), &quot;Factors&quot; (prime factors of
ratios), &quot;Cent&quot; (cent values), &quot;Note&quot; (note names, if known), &quot;Interval&quot;
(interval descriptions, for known intervals) and &quot;Ordinal&quot; (scale index).
These items have the same meaning as the corresponding columns on the
<tt class="docutils literal">Scale</tt> tab, see <a class="reference internal" href="#the-scale-view">The Scale View</a> below for details.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Weights</tt>: Enables or disables the edge weight display, which shows the
harmonic distances between scale points.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Edge weight function</tt>: A combobox which lets you choose between various
harmonic distance functions, currently: &quot;Barlow&quot; (Barlow's indigestability
metric) and &quot;Euler&quot; (Euler's gradus suavitatis). The other functions are
variations of these (the &quot;/2&quot; versions set the harmonic distance of octaves
to zero, and the &quot;Log&quot; variations take the decadic logarithm of the Euler
and Barlow metrics). Changing the weight function produces different
drawings and information on the Scale and Metric tabs, so you're prompted to
redraw the scale when changing this value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these, the already mentioned &quot;weight threshold&quot; spinbox to the right
of the scale entry field also influences the display of the harmonicity
graph. Only those edges between scale points will be drawn whose harmonic
distance does not exceed the value given in the spinbox. Moreover, the edges
are color-coded (blue denotes low, red high harmonic distances).</p>

<div class="section" id="the-scale-view">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scale View</a></h1>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Scale</tt> tab shows detailed information about the current scale in the
form of a table whose columns include the following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Select</tt>: This column allows you to select pitches for the rationalization
algorithm, see the comments below and <a class="reference internal" href="#rationalizing-a-scale">Rationalizing a Scale</a> for details.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">#</tt>: Ordinal numbers (starting at zero = base tone).</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Pitch</tt>: The ratio or cent value, as given in the scale entry field.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Factors</tt>: The factorization of the pitch, if it is rational.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Cent</tt>: The corresponding cent value.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Weight</tt>: The disharmonicity value of the interval (for rational pitches
only), as given by the weight function on the <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> tab.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Note</tt>: The note name, if available.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Interval</tt>: The name of the interval from the Scala intnam.par file, if
available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note names are computed automatically from a factorization of the ratios,
assuming a &quot;standard&quot; tuning for the prime factors. At present, this is only
implemented for rational pitches with the prime factors 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11,
i.e., for &quot;11-limit&quot; pitches. 1/1 always denotes the base note C, and the
other note names are computed relative to that.</p>
<p>The first column in the scale view allows you to select both scale points and
the corresponding tuning alternatives. Selected scale points are considered
&quot;locked&quot; for the purpose of scale rationalization. By default, all scale
points are selected which are rational already. Also, for scale points for
which alternative tunings are available, there is a tiny arrowhead in this
column. Clicking on the arrowhead symbol expands the corresponding scale point
and shows the available candidate tunings.</p>
<p>You can also click on the column headers to sort the scale view based on the
values in the corresponding column. This is most useful for the numeric
columns (<tt class="docutils literal">#</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Cent</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Weight</tt>). By default, the table is ordered by
ordinals (<tt class="docutils literal">#</tt>), meaning that the scale points are listed in the order in
which they are written in the scale entry field. Clicking on a column title
once sorts the table in ascending order. Clicking the same column title again
reverses the order so that the values in the column are listed in descending
order.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the <tt class="docutils literal">Scale</tt> tab there is a strip with operations and
parameters for selecting scale points and alternative tunings and controlling
the rationalization algorithm:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Clear</tt>: Deselect all scale points and alternative tunings.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Select All</tt>: Select all candidate tunings for which the corresponding
scale point is <em>not</em> selected (i.e., unlocked).</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Refresh</tt>: Refresh the scale display (in particular, this updates the
available candidate tunings). This is usually done after changing the number
of candidate tunings and tuning tolerance parameters (see below) as well as
the weight threshold parameter in the main window.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Number of tuning alternatives</tt>: A spinbox which allows you to select the
maximum number of alternative tunings to be shown for each scale point.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Tuning tolerance</tt>: Another spinbox with which you choose the maximum
tuning tolerance for the alternative tunings for each scale point.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Rationalization heuristic</tt>: This lets you choose between different
candidate tuning selection heuristics for the automatic rationalization
algorithm. The present implementation provides two alternatives, &quot;First&quot; and
&quot;Best&quot;.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Rationalize</tt>: Automatic scale rationalization algorithm.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Update</tt>: After selecting some alternative tunings, clicking this button
updates and redraws the scale in the main window accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these, the &quot;weight threshold&quot; spinbox to the right of the scale entry
field determines which tuning alternatives are shown for each scale point.
Only tuning alternatives with a disharmonicity value of at most the threshold
value are shown. Moreover, for each scale point the table shows at most n
tuning alternatives in the range c-tol ... c+tol, where c is the cent value of
the scale point (as given in the <tt class="docutils literal">Cent</tt> column of the table), and tol and n
are the tuning tolerance and the number of tuning alternatives, as given by
the corresponding spinboxes.</p>
<p>The order of the alternative tunings for each scale tone depends not only on
their nominal disharmonicity values but also on their absolute deviation from
the scale point in cents. To these ends, the scale program computes &quot;weighted&quot;
disharmonicity values using a formula by Barlow, described in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/Musikinformatik/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a>.
(The idea behind this is that the nominal disharmonicity values are scaled
using a Gaussian bell curve which has its center at the current pitch of the
scale point in Cents.) The first tuning alternative shown for a scale point is
thus the &quot;best&quot; rational approximation of the scale tone according to this
criterion, which is a compromise between harmonicity and tuning accuracy.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-metric-view">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metric View</a></h1>
<p>For rational scales, the <tt class="docutils literal">Metric</tt> tab shows the harmonic distance metric
used in drawing and rationalizing a scale. It takes the form of a matrix which
shows for each pair x,y of scale points their harmonic distance, i.e., the
disharmonicity of the interval x/y between the scale points. The weight
function used to determine these values can be chosen with the &quot;edge weight
function&quot; combobox on the <tt class="docutils literal">Graph</tt> tab.</p>

<div class="section" id="rationalizing-a-scale">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationalizing a Scale</a></h1>
<p>If a scale isn't rational yet then it is not possible to analyze the interval
structure of a scale since this requires knowing the rational relationships
between the scale tones. On the <tt class="docutils literal">Scale</tt> tab you find the necessary tools to
rationalize a scale using the following methods:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>Manual rationalization</cite>: Here you simply select the desired rational tuning
alternatives for each scale tone and then use <tt class="docutils literal">Update</tt> to update the scale
data and redraw the scale. You can select more than one tuning alternative
for each scale tone. In such a case the first alternative will be chosen,
depending on the current order of the alternatives in the table. Thus the
easiest way to quickly obtain a rationalization is to just click <tt class="docutils literal">Select
All</tt> and then <tt class="docutils literal">Update</tt>.</li>
<li><cite>Automatic rationalization</cite>: This uses a clique search algorithm on the
harmonicity graph to determine a collection of selected tuning alternatives
(at most one per scale point) for which the mutual harmonic distances do not
exceed the bound given in the &quot;weight threshold&quot; spinbox. The selection of
the tuning alternatives is then modified to reflect the computed solution.
When done, just click <tt class="docutils literal">Update</tt> as with the manual method to update the
scale using the computed solution.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="fixing-parts-of-the-scale">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixing Parts of the Scale</a></h2>
<p>With either method, selected scale points are considered <em>locked</em>, i.e., they
will not be modified by <tt class="docutils literal">Rationalize</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Update</tt>. (However, the
automatic rationalization algorithm does take into account locked <em>rational</em>
scale points when computing the eligible tuning alternatives.) By default,
rational scale points are selected and thus considered locked. If you want to
re-rationalize these as well, you first need to deselect them in order to
unlock them. The quickest way to do this is to click the <tt class="docutils literal">Clear</tt> button
which deselects all scale points (as well as all tuning alternatives). Then
use <tt class="docutils literal">Select All</tt> to select all tuning alternatives (or select the ones that
you want manually) before running <tt class="docutils literal">Rationalize</tt> and/or <tt class="docutils literal">Update</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automatic-rationalization">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic Rationalization</a></h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Rationalize</tt> command employs a backtracking clique search algorithm
which explores exponentially many possibilities in the worst case and thus may
be <em>very</em> slow, depending on the number of available tuning alternatives. To
deal with this, you may try to restrict the number of tuning alternatives or
fix some tunings manually beforehand.</p>
<p>You can also just run the algorithm and interrupt it at any time using the
<tt class="docutils literal">Esc</tt> key. The progress of the algorithm towards an optimum solution which
rationalizes all unlocked scale points is shown in the progress bar in the
main window. Usually, the algorithm will converge to a local optimum pretty
quickly (indicated by no further changes in the progress bar), at which point
you may hit <tt class="docutils literal">Esc</tt> to interrupt the algorithm and see whether the computed
solution provides at least a viable partial rationalization of the scale.</p>
<p>The rationalization algorithm can also be adjusted by employing different
search heuristics. You can find these in the <tt class="docutils literal">Rationalization heuristic</tt>
combobox. In the current program version, only two search heuristics are
provided:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">First</tt>: Scale points and tuning alternatives are considered in the order
in which they are shown in the table. This strategy works pretty well if
enough &quot;good&quot; candidate tunings are available and is the default.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">Best</tt>: This strategy selects tuning alternatives dynamically in order to
minimize the total disharmonicity in the chosen rationalization. This tends
to produce overall better solutions, but is slower than the <tt class="docutils literal">First</tt>
strategy and may also produce &quot;funny&quot; tunings for some scale points at
times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future versions of the program may add more search heuristics as we find new
ways to guide the search towards good solutions. But note that the scale
rationalization problem is inherently difficult (NP-hard in computer science
parlance, see the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/Musikinformatik/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a> for details) and thus no search heuristic can
guarantee to find good solutions quickly in all cases (unless P=NP, of course,
but this is considered very unlikely by most experts).</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performing a Rationalization</a></h2>
<p>To summarize, here is an outline of the basic steps of the rationalization
process:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
<li>Make sure that the current scale is saved, so that you can easily reload it
and start over if things go awry.</li>
<li>Choose a weight threshold value (and possibly a tuning tolerance and a
number of tuning alternatives) and do a <tt class="docutils literal">Refresh</tt> until a suitable set of
tuning alternatives is shown.</li>
<li>Select the scale points that you want to stay fixed, and deselect the ones
that you want to be rationalized. By default, all rational scale points are
selected already which is often a sensible choice, so you can skip this
step if you're content with the default selection. You can also use
<tt class="docutils literal">Clear</tt> if you want to just re-rationalize everything.</li>
<li>Select the eligible tuning alternatives. Or just do <tt class="docutils literal">Select All</tt> to
select all tuning alternatives. (This also expands the corresponding scale
points if necessary to show all selected alternatives.)</li>
<li>Use <tt class="docutils literal">Rationalize</tt> to try an automatic rationalization. (Use the <tt class="docutils literal">Esc</tt>
key to interrupt it if it takes too long.) You might need to increase the
weight threshold and/or fine-tune the selection of tuning alternatives to
obtain a satisfactory result using this method. (If you already selected
some suitable tuning alternatives that you want to use, you can also just
skip this step and directly proceed to step 5.)</li>
<li>Use <tt class="docutils literal">Update</tt> to update the scale and redraw it.</li>
<li>If all scale tones are rational now then you're done. Otherwise, just
repeat the steps 1-5 above until you're satisfied with the result.</li>
<li>If the solution you got is not what you wanted, just use <tt class="docutils literal">Revert</tt> to
revert to the original version of the scale and start over.</li>
