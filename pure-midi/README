This is a MIDI interface for the Pure programming language. It includes the
following modules:

* midi.pure: A PortMidi/PortTime wrapper which gives you portable access to
  realtime MIDI input and output. This uses PortMidi (by Roger B. Dannenberg
  et al) from the PortMedia project, see http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/.

* midifile.pure: Reading and writing standard MIDI files. This is based on
  David G. Slomin's light-weight midifile library, which comes bundled with
  the pure-midi sources.

* realtime.pure: A little utility module, provides access to realtime
  scheduling to applications which need it, on systems which have the required
  functionality in the POSIX threads library. (Linux, OSX and other Un*x
  systems should offer this, Windows probably needs some work.)

Documentation still needs to be written, so for the time being please read the
source modules listed above and have a look at the examples provided in the
distribution.

Installation
------------

You need to have the PortMidi library installed on your system. This release
was tested with PortMidi 2.00 (I recommend using the svn version of PortMidi,
since it fixes some 64 bit compilation problems). If you have to use some
earlier PortMidi version then you may have to fiddle with portmidi.pure and/or
midi.pure to make it work. (You can also just regenerate the wrapper by
copying portmidi.h and porttime.h from your PortMidi installation to the
pure-midi source directory and running 'make generate'. This requires
pure-gen. See the toplevel Makefile for details.)

Run 'make' to compile the package. If you're lucky and everything compiles
smoothly, you can install with 'sudo make install'.

If you're not so lucky, you can get help on the Pure mailing list, see
http://groups.google.com/group/pure-lang.
