====================================================
A REDUCE Interface for the Pure Programming Language
====================================================

This is a module providing access to the REDUCE_ computer algebra system from
Pure. It is based on the `PROC interface`_ (a "procedural" interface to embed
REDUCE as a C library). You'll need the shared reduce.so (or reduce.dll)
library, and a REDUCE image file (reduce.img) to make this work. Kurt Pagani,
who contributed the original version of this module, has written up a few
notes which discuss how to build the REDUCE library and image file, see the
accompanying pure_reduce.txt file for details. More detailed information and a
discussion of the interface can be found in the `Embedding REDUCE`_ thread on
the Pure mailing list.

The interface can be found in reduce.pure (in particular, have a look at the
"high-level interface" at the end of the module), some basic examples are in
reduce_examp.pure. Please note that at present, this module is still highly
experimental and under heavy development. But the basic functionality appears
to work, and you're welcome to discuss the new interface on the mailing list
and/or submit bug reports and patches.
