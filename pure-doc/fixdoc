# Synopsis: fixdoc latex-input-file > latex-output-file

# 'fixdoc' is a little utility script which attempts to clean up some of the
# mess that older svn versions of rst2latex produce. Specifically, it deals
# with incorrect nested \hyperref calls, and itemize/description environments
# getting split at link targets, which is rather inconvenient since pure-doc
# can't handle inlined link targets right now.

# As an added bonus, 'fixdoc' also adds LaTeX labels to link targets and
# augments index entries with page numbers. Note that the latter only works if
# the index is in its own section named 'Index'.

# This script shouldn't be needed for the latest svn versions of rst2latex any
# more.
