# Synopsis: fixdoc latex-input-file > latex-output-file

# 'fixdoc' is a little utility script which attempts to clean up some of the
# mess that rst2latex produces. Specifically, sequences of link targets seem
# to produce nested \hyperref calls for some mysterious reason, and itemize
# and description environments get split at link targets, which is rather
# inconvenient since pure-doc can't handle inlined link targets right now.

# As an added bonus, 'fixdoc' also adds LaTeX labels to link targets and
# augments index entries with page numbers. Note that the latter only works if
# the index is in its own section named 'Index'.

  # Remove nested link targets (bug in rst2latex?).
