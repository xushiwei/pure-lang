/* Some basic examples for the orddict module. This is intended to be fed to
   the interpreter in a piecemeal fashion (best done using "Send Current Line"
   in Emacs). To see the results, you can also run the script from the command
   line as follows: pure < orddict_examp.pure

   NOTE: In this directory you'll also find a log file generated by running
   this script through Pure. You can run the script yourself and compare the
   results with the log to see whether the orddict module works ok on your
   system. The Makefile has a target which automatizes this; simply run 'make
   check' in the main source directory. */

/* Create an orddict and populate it with some Pure data. Both keys and values
   may be arbitrary Pure expressions. The key values in a dict must all be
   ordered using the standard '<' predicate. This is also the order that will
   be used when printing an orddict or extracting its members. In the
   following examples, the predefined orders on strings and numbers will be
   used, but of course you can also use your own custom data types if you
   define '<' on them. */

   It is also possible to define a custom pretty-printing, using your own
   preferred symbol in place of 'orddict'. In particular, the symbol may also
   be an outfix symbol so that orddicts can be printed and entered in a
   bracketed format analogous to list and matrix notation. The following code
   shows how to make this work. To these ends, we introduce a nonfix symbol
   {$$} denoting the empty orddict (note that this must be written as is, with
   no spaces between the "brackets"), and a corresponding pair of outfix
   symbols {$ $} which will be used to denote non-empty dicts. */
