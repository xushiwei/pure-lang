/* oscseq object: Simple OSC recorder and sequencer. This object is to be
   driven by midiseq which provides the timebase. The name of the osc file is
   specified as a creation argument. The object understands the following
   messages:

   - offset t starts playback/recording at the given time offset in msec
   - stop or abort stops playback/recording
   - clear purges the sequence so that you can start recording a new one
   - save saves the current sequence in the file specified by the creation arg
   - record 0 and record 1 disable and enable recording, respectively

   Recorded OSC messages are output on the outlet. When in recording mode, OSC
   messages received on the inlet (actually anything that doesn't look like
   one of the messages above) are recorded during playback; a stop message
   then stores the recorded sequence. An abort message works like stop, but
   throws away the current recording. A clear message purges the entire
   recording so that you can start a new one. */
