Optimizations:

- Deactivated units should be skipped in computation once their output falls
  below a certain threshold.

Features:

- Add metadata support to pick up layout parameters (width, height, fake
  buttons, slider radios, etc.). Add an 'invisible' attribute so that the
  display of controls can be suppressed.

- Support for multichannel dsps. (Only stereo units are fully supported right
  now.)

- OSC support for passive controls. Maybe we'd like to output these to an OSC
  client?

- Implement passive controls in fsynth~ objects. The problem here is how to
  aggregate the values of the different voices: sum, average, min, max?

Bugs and Design Issues:

- Some of the included faust-stk instruments have bugs (badly out of tune
  and/or refusing to work for certain parameter combinations). Check with the
  faust-stk developers at CCRMA to get these fixed.

- Refactor the sources so that fsynth~ and fdsp~ share as much code as
  possible.

- How should voice controls (freq, gain, gate) be handled? They are currently
  addressed using their basename only (without path), and only one of these
  (the first one) will be used if different instances of a voice control exist
  in different subgroups. Also, we may want to make the basenames of the voice
  controls configurable.

- How to handle coarse/fine MIDI controllers?
