Optimizations:

- Deactivated units should be skipped in computation once their output falls
  below a certain threshold.

Features:

- Add metadata support to pick up layout parameters (width, height, fake
  buttons, slider radios, etc.). Add an 'invisible' attribute so that the
  display of controls can be suppressed.

- Add support for multichannel dsps. (Only stereo units are fully supported
  right now.)

- Add support for OSC input and output in the midiosc abstraction.

- Implement passive controls in fsynth~ objects. The problem here is how to
  aggregate the values of the different voices: sum, average, min, max?

- Add support for polyphonic aftertouch and channel pressure messages, it
  should be possible to map these to Faust controls as well.

Design Issues:

- Refactor the sources so that fsynth~ and fdsp~ share as much code as
  possible.

- Voice controls (freq, gain, gate) are currently addressed using their
  basename only (without path), and only one of these (the first one) will be
  used if different instances of a voice control exist in different subgroups.
  This is done for efficiency, but it might be useful to handle multiple
  instances of the voice controls in different subgroups. Also, we may want
  to make the basenames of the voice controls configurable.

- There's no special handling of coarse/fine MIDI controllers in the current
  implementation. Maybe there should be a way to map them to a single Faust
  control?
