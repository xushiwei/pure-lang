Description: FFI interface for the Pure programming language
 Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term
 rewriting. This module provides an interface to libffi which enables you to
 call C functions from Pure and vice versa. It goes beyond Pure's built-in C
 interface in that it also handles C structs and makes Pure functions callable
 from C.
