Changes to be made before release
---------------------------------

Add 100% coverage for index out of bounds, range overflow etc. STL does not
generally check for out of bound indexes, copy overflow, etc. In this regard
it is like raw C. Currently, Pure-stl does check for these issues, except in a
low number of cases. E.g., set intersection with result into an existing
stlvec (i.e., not a back insert), where you don't know the size of the
result. I think it would be better to back insert onto an empty temp vector,
check if the result fits, and only then copy into the middle of a vector.

Make bad_function checks on call-back functions more robust in stlbase. 

Add ut_errors.pure

Enhancements
------------

Consider adding interfaces to STL's map and GNU STL's hash map. No algorithms
would be provided -- just the container interfaces. For me this has low
priority, given dict, but it would round out the STl interface.

Improve error reporting.

Changes Development Files
-------------------------

Eventually remove ut_x_sv_refc.pure.


Code Changes
------------

Change copyright/licence notice when package is ready to be released. Will be
the same as for pure-sql3.

Consider some renaming (generally to longer names) to make the code easier to
read.

Add more comments.


README Changes
==============

Reflect the above changes.

Finish the rough draft -- there are missing and incomplete sections. E.g.,
installation, error handling.

Edit and proof the current rough draft.
