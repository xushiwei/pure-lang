XML/XSLT interface for the Pure programming language
====================================================

This is a port of the Q XML module to Pure.

For this module to work, you must have the libxml2 and libxslt libraries from
the GNOME project installed. If you have a Linux system then you most likely
have these libraries, otherwise you can get them from http://xmlsoft.org. For
Windows users, the required dlls are available from the GnuWin32 project
(http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net) and are already included in the Pure MSI
package.

XML is the Extensible Markup Language, facilitating exchange of complex
structured data between different applications and systems. XSLT allows you to
transform XML documents to other XML-based formats such as HTML. Together XML
and XSLT let you create dynamic web content with ease. Both XML and XSLT are
open standards by the W3C consortium (http://www.w3.org).

More details about the provided functionality can be found in xml.pure. Please
also check out the examples in the examples directory.

Enjoy! :)
