Pure-XML - XML/XSLT interface
=============================

XML_, the Extensible Markup Language, facilitates the exchange of complex
structured data between applications and systems. XSLT_ allows you to
transform XML documents to other XML-based formats such as HTML. Together, XML
and XSLT let you create dynamic web content with ease. Both XML and XSLT are
open standards by the W3C consortium (http://www.w3.org).

.. _XML: http://www.w3.org/TR/xml
.. _XSLT: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt

Pure's XML interface is based on the libxml2 and libxslt libraries from the
GNOME project. If you have a Linux system then you most likely have these
libraries, otherwise you can get them from http://xmlsoft.org. For Windows
users, the required dlls are available from the GnuWin32 project
(http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net) and are already included in the Pure MSI
package.
