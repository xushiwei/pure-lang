This is a quick and dirty Pure wrapper for the liblo_ library by Steve Harris
and others, which implements Berkeley's `Open Sound Control`_ (OSC) protocol.

OSC is a protocol for exchanging data between multimedia devices and software
across the network (TCP, UDP and UNIX domain sockets are supported as the
transport layer). It is also useful as a general communication mechanism for
both hard- and software. In difference to the plain socket interface (on which
it builds), OSC provides you with an efficient means to send around binary
data packets along with the corresponding type and timing information, which
makes it well-suited for both realtime and non-realtime applications.

The OSC protocol is standardized_ and is supported by an abundance of
different implementations_, which includes controller hardware of all sorts
and computer music software like CSound, Pd and SuperCollider. Lots of
implementations exist for different programming languages. liblo aims to
provide a lightweight and ubiquitous OSC implementation for the C programming
language.

The ``lo.pure`` module provides a fairly straight wrapper of the C library. A
more high-level and Purified interface is available in ``osc.pure``. Most of
the time, you'll want to use the latter for convenience, but if you need
utmost flexibility then it is worth having a look at ``lo.pure``, too.

* To install, run ``make`` and ``sudo make install``. This will try to guess
  your Pure installation directory; if it guesses wrong, you can set the
  ``prefix`` variable accordingly, see the Makefile for details.

* You can also regenerate the wrapper by running ``make generate``; this
  requires the ``pure-gen`` utility and the liblo headers.

* Have a look at ``lo.pure`` and ``osc.pure`` for a description of the API
  provided to Pure programmers.

* The ``examples`` folder contains some Pure code which illustrates how to use
  these modules.

Enjoy!
