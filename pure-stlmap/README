Introduction
============

Supported Containers
--------------------

A part of the Standard C++ Library`_ that is often refered to as the standard
template library ("STL") provides templates for generic containers and generic
algorithms. pure-stlmap provides six mutable containers "stlmap", "stlset",
"stlmmap", "stlmset", "stlhmap" and "stlhset" that are thin wrappers around
the corresponding associative containers provided by the STL: map, set,
multimap, multiset, unordered_map and unordered_set. pure-stlmap does not
provide wrappers for unordered_multimap and unordered_multiset. In addition,
the interfaces for stlhmap and stlhset are limited compared to those provided
for the other four (ordered) associative containers.

Correspondence with the Native Interface
----------------------------------------

The core functions provided by pure-stlmap, such as the constructors,
equivalence and lexicographical comparison operations, insert and erase
operations, and the set operations are just thin wrappers around the the
corresponding C++ functions.

An important disadvantage of this approach is that often the STL functions do
not have the same semantics as similar functions standard Pure library. For
example, if m is a stlmap or stlhmap and if k is already stored in m, ``insert
m (k=>v)`` will not change the value associated with k to v. If m were a
stldict, or dict, the value would be changed. (If you want this behavior, you
can use pure-stlmap's `insert_or_update` function).

Another disadvantage is that the C++ library is in sometimes more complicated
than the Pure Library. For example many of the applicable C++ functions,
including set operations and tests for equality are based on lexicographical
ordering. For stlset and stlmap, the ordering is handled automatically, so
there is no inconvenience once you get used to the idea. However, in the case
of stlmmap and stlmset, care must be taken to ensure that elements with the
same key are properly lexicographically ordered, or the applicable C++
functions will not work properly. In contrast, the set operations supplied by
the Pure Library, just work -- you don't have to think about these things. The
C++ approach might take some getting used to, but the benefit is O(n) time
complexity for set operations (as opposed to the Pure Library's O(n log n)
time complexity).

The main advantage of mirroring the C++ library is that users can consult the
C++ Library documentation to understand the performance characteristics and
corner case behavior of any pure-stlmap function that has a corresponding
function in the STL. In addition calling underlying STL functions on a
one-to-one basis preserves O(n) time complexity for certain operations,
including set operations, that would be difficult to guarantee if the
operations were reimplemented by hand in order to conform to Pure standard
library behavior. Finally, it must be said that, in spite of its apparent
complexity, STL is one of the most carefully defined and most used container
libraries available.

Installation
============

pure-stlmap-@version@ requires at least Pure 0.48. The latest version of Pure
is available at http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/downloads/list.

The latest version of the source code for pure-stlmap can be downloaded from
http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/pure-stlmap-@version@.tar.gz.
 
Before installing pure-stlmap, you need to install pure-stlvec. After you have
installed pure-stlvec, extract the source code for pure-stlmap (e.g., tar -xzf
pure-stlmap-@version@.tar.gz), cd to the pure-stlmap-@version@ directory, and
run ``make`` and then ``sudo make install`` to install pure-stlmap on your
(Linux) system.  ``make`` tries to guess your Pure installation directory and
platform-specific setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables
manually. In particular, ``make install prefix=/usr`` sets the installation
prefix. Please see the Makefile for details.

Containers and Ranges Used in Examples
======================================

The code snippets that appear in the rest of this document assume that
something similar to the following has been entered at the prompt. ::

   pure-stlmap$> pure -q
   > using stlmap, stlhmap, stlmmap;
   > using namespace stl;

   > // Make some maps and sets with default characteristics
   > let sm  = stlmap  ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];
   > let shm = stlhmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];
   > let smm = stlmmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];
   > let ss  = stlset  ["a","b","c","d","e"];
   > let shs = stlhset ["a","b","c","d","e"];
   > let sms = stlmset ["a","b","c","c","d"];

   > // Define some ranges
   > let sm_rng  = sm,"b","d";
   > let smm_rng = smm,"b","d";
   > let ss_rng  = ss,"b","d";
   > let sms_rng = sm,"b","d";

You might consider pasting this code into a temp.pure file that can be loaded
into the Pure interpreter if you want to try things out as you read the manual.

Quick Start Examples
====================

Hopefully, a quick read of these examples should get you up and running with
pure-stlmap.

Constructors and Insertion
--------------------------

The section Containers and Ranges Used in Examples shows how to make a new
associative container form a list of elements. You can also make empty
containers. ::

   > let sm1 = emptystlmap ;

You can add elements using insert or insert_or_update. 

   > insert sm1 (sm,"b","e"); // insert sm's elements with keys "a" to "d"
   3

   > elms sm1;
   ["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4]

   > insert_or_update sm1 ("d"=>40) $$ elms sm1;
   ["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>40,"e"=>50]

The insert function will not "insert" elements with a key that is already
stored in the target container.

   > insert sm1 ("e"=>5);    // insert element with new key
   #<pointer 0xa95cc60>,1    // returns (iterator, true)

   > elms sm1;               // check that "e"=>5 was inserted
   ["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>40,"e"=>5]

   > insert sm1 ("e"=>50);   // attempt insert where key already in sm1
   #<pointer 0xaa08cb8>,0    // returns (iterator, false)

   > elms sm1;               // Note that "e"=>5 was not updated
   ["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>40,"e"=>5]


Access
------

The value (or values for a multi-key container) associated with a key can be
accessed using the (!) operator. ::

    > sm!"a";
    1

    > shm!"b";
    2

    > smm!"c";
    [31,32]

An associative container elements or a (sub)range of its elements can
be accessed using the elms function. As expected, the elements of the ordered
containers are indeed ordered and those in the unordered containers are
not. ::

    > elms ss;
    ["a","b","c","d","e"]   

    > elms shs;
    ["d","e","a","b","c"]

    > elms ss_rng;
    ["b","c"]

    > elms (shm,"b","d"); // fails - ranges not supported for stlhmaps
    stl::elms (#<pointer 0x83b4908>,"b","d")

Note that the last element in the range specification is not included in the
range. Also, ranges are not supported for stlhmap and stlhset.

List-Like Operations
--------------------


More Examples
-------------

Many more examples can be found in the pure-stlmap/ut directory.


Usage
=====

After installation of pure-stlmap (and pure-stlvec), you can use the operations
of this package by placing one or more the following import declarations in
your Pure programs::

  using stlmap;
  using stlmmap;
  using stlhmap;

As mentioned, pure-stlvec must be installed before you can use
pure-stlvec. That said, you do not need to import stlvec (i.e., with a using
statement) to use stlmap, stlmmap or stlhmap. And pure-stlmap does not itself
import stlvec. Also, if you import stlmap, stlmmap or stlhmap but not stlvec,
you will be able to produce a stlvec that contains the elements of a given
stlmap, but you will not be able to access the stlvec's members. ::

   > let sm  = stlmap  ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]; // make a stlmap

   > let sv = stlvec sm;  // make a stlvec

   > sv!3;                // fails, (!) not defined for stlvecs
   STLVEC #<pointer 0xa546978>!3

   > using stlvec;        // now (!) is defined for stlvecs
   > sv!3;
   "d"=>4


Fundamentals - Containers, Iterators, Ranges and Their Elements
===============================================================

This section describes the objects and concepts that underly
pure-stlmap. These include the supported containers, iterators, ranges,
elements, keys, values and a group of functions that help define a container's
behavior.

Containers
----------

The six associative containers supported by pure-stlmap can be grouped
together in terms of certain defining attributes. 

  * associative container - stlmap, stlset, stlmmap, stlmmset, stlhmap or
                            stlhset

  * ordered container - stlmap, stlset, stlmmap, stlmmset

  * unique-keyed container - stlmap, stlset, stlhmap, stlhset

  * multi-keyed container - stlmmap, stlmset

  * unordered container - stlhmap, stlhset

  * map - stlmap, stlmmap, stlhmap

  * ordered map - stlmap, stlmmap

  * unique-keyed map - stlmap, stlhmap

  * multi-keyed map - stlmmap

  * unordered map - stlhmap
  
  * set - stlset, stlmset, stlhset

  * ordered set - stlset, stlmset

  * unique-keyed set - stlset, stlhset

  * multi-keyed set - stlmset

  * unordered set - stlhset

Hopefully these names are intuitive enough that defining them here was not
really necessary. On the other hand, the groupings do summarize what is
available in this package.

Keys, Values and Elements
-------------------------

The three maps provided by pure-stlmap (stlmap, stlmmap and stlhmap) associate
values with keys. If a value v is associated with a key, k, in an map, m, then
we say that (k=>v) is an element of m and that k is stored in m. The three
sets provided by pure-stlmap (stlset, stlmset and stlhset) simply hold single
elements, as opposed to key value pairs. If an element e is contained a set,
s, we say that e is an element of s, that e is stored in s, that s has key e
and that s has value e. In other words, we sometimes speak of a set as if it
were a map where each element, key and value are the same object.

Functions That Define Customized Containers
-------------------------------------------

Each ordered container (stlmap, stlset, stlmmap, and stlmset) has a
key-less-than function that is used to order its elements by key. In addition,
stlmap and stlmmap each have a value-less-than function and a value-equal
function. Two keys are "equivalent" if neither key is key-less-than the
other. For purposes of lexicographical comparisons one element, e1, is less
than another, e2, if (a) e1's key is less-than e2's key and, (b) if the
ordered container is a stlmap or stlmap, e1's value is value-less-than e2's
value. Finally, for purposes of determining if two containers are equal, e1
and e2 are considered to be equal if (a) their keys are equivalent and (b),
ifn the case of stlmap or stlmmap, their values are value-equal. The default
key-less-than function, (<), value-less-than function (<), and value-equal
function generally work well, but customized versions can be specified when
the ordered container is constructed.

The unordered containers (stlhmap and sthset) do not have a key-less-than or a
value-less-than function. Instead, they have a hash function, a key-equal
function and a value-equal function. These default to 'hash', '(==)' and
'(==)' respectively, but customized functions can be specified when the
container is constructed. If e1 and e2 are elements of unordered maps, they
are considered to be equal if they are key-equal and value-equal.

Accessing Elements
------------------

In pure-stlmap, an element can be thought of as occupying a slot that is
identified by its container and key. You can get a pointer to the slot,
referred to as an iterator, and then read or modify the element. ::

   > let sm  = stlmap  ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];

   > let p = find sm "b";
   > get p;
   "b"=>2

   > put p 20;
   20

   > elms sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>10,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

If you don't like iterators, you can use pure-stlmap's "key-based" interface. ::

  > get (sm,"c");
  "c"=>3

  > put (sm,"c") 30;
  30

  > elms sm;
  ["a"=>1,"b"=>20,"c"=>30,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

  > sm!"a";
  1

When it comes to the multi-keyed containers (stlmmap and stlmset), iterators
are used the same as for the unique-keyed containers (stlmap and
stlset). However, because access is always by key, and never by key value
pairs, it is not possible to access use the key-based interface to access a
single element. As a result, the key-based put and get functions work with
the elements associated with a given key on a all or nothing basis. ::

   let smm = stlmmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4];

   > get (smm,"c");
   "c"=>[31,32]

   > put (smm,"c") [31,32,33];
   3

   > elms smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"c"=>33,"d"=>4]

   > put (smm,"c") [];
   0

   > elms smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

Please note that elements are never identified by key value pairs. I.e., the
value never is used to locate an element. Thus, if you want to delete "c"=>32
from smm while preserving "c"=>31 and "c"=>33 using the key-based interface
you have to use put, i.e., you cannot say something like delete_val smm
("c"=>32) ::

   > put (smm,"c") [31,33];
   2

   > elms smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>33,"e"=>5]

If this is not convenient, you can always use iterators to track down and deal
with any element individually.

Finally, it should be noted that you cannot modify an element's key, only its
value. If you want to do that, you have to erase the element and insert a new
element.

Iterators and Ranges
--------------------

The native STL interface is based on "iterators" that point to elements in
containers. pure-stlmap provides support for iterators defined on its ordered
containers (stlmap, stlmmap, stlset and stlmset) but not for its unordered
containers (stlhmap and stlhset).

Given a valid iterator you can access, modify or erase the element it points
to.  Given two iterators, i and j, pointing into a ordered container oc, the
range (i,j), denotes oc's elements starting with "oc[i]", the element pointed
to by i, up to but not including oc[j]. In pure-stlmap, this range is denoted
by the tuple (i,j). ::

   > elms sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > let i = stl::find sm1 "b"; // get the iterator

   > let j = stl::find sm1 "e";

   > elms (i,j);               // get the elements in the range
   ["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4]

It is also possible to define a range using keys. Given an ordered container,
oc, and keys k and l, the range (oc,k,l) consists of all of the elements in
aoc starting with the first element that is not less than k up to but
not including the first element that is greater or equal to l. Note that k and
l do not have to be stored in oc. ::

   > elms (sm,"b","e");
   ["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4]

   > elms (sm,"c1",smend);
   ["d"=>4,"e"=>5]

When a range is passed to a function provided by pure-stlmap, the keys can be
dropped, in which case the range consists of all of the container's elements.

   > elms sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

Please note that support for iterators and ranges is not provided for the
unordered containers (stlhmap and stlhset). Most pure-stlmap functions that act
on ranges can, however, operate on stlhmaps or stlhsets as well, except that,
for stlhmaps and stlhsets, they always operate on all of the container's
elements. Accordingly, whenever the documentation of a function refers to a
range, and the container in question is a a stlhmap or stlhset, the range
simply refers to the container itself.

Functional Interface for Working with Ranges
--------------------------------------------

The usual list operations including map, foldl, do, etc. are available for all
six containers provided by pure-stlmap. They operate directly on the
underlying data, so it is not necessary, for example, to make a list of
elements and foldl over the list.

It is possible to use iterators or key oriented functions to "manually" move
through the elements in a range, as if one were programming in C++, but this
is not recommended unless there is no alternative. As is the case with lists,
your code will probably be faster and easier to understand if you stick with
map, foldl, filter, etc., rather than maintaining pointers, be they iterators
or keys, into a container. E.g.,::

  > filter (\(k=>v)->v mod 2) sm;
   ["a"=>1,"c"=>3,"e"=>5]

Clearly it would be painful move through the elements via a recursive loop
that bumps keys using `next_key` and pushes filtered elements onto a list.

In short, it should be possible to apply most if not all of the functional
programming idioms that you use with lists to the containers provided by
pure-stlmap.

Modules, Types and Namespaces
=============================

Modules
-------

pure-stlmap provides three separate modules ``stlmap``, ``stlmmap`` and
``stlhmap``. If you want to use a stlmap or stlset, import stlmap. For
stlmmaps and stlmsets import stlmmap and for stlhmaps aor stlhsets import
stlhmap. This separation reflects the idea that ordered maps, unordered maps
and multimaps (and their corresponding set containers) each have unique
charateristics and that they are not meant to be interchangable
implimentations of a common interface. For example, in order to guarantee O(n)
set operations, stl-pure the set operations are defined on the ordered
containers, stlmap, stlset, stlmmap and stlmset, but not on stlhmap or
stlhset.

Namespaces
----------

Global and stl. Operators all in ::. Constructors and types in :: If function
already exists in ::, then :: (e.g., put, get, foldl, etc).

Add a table

.. namespace:: ::

The stlmap Module
-----------------

Consider using the stlmap module which provides stlmap or stlset unless there
is some compelling reason to use one of the others. The time complexity is
guaranteed and having ordered elements is often very useful. E.g., sparse
arrays. In pure-stlmap, these two containers support ranges and the key
oriented functions cache iterators to speed up key based lookups. Finally, if
you are using set operations, these two are probably your best choice.

You can import the stlmap module by adding the following using statement to
your code. ::

  > using stlmap;

Importing the stlmap module introduces types to describe stlmap and stlset,
their iterators and ranges defined on them. ::

.. type:: stlmap /type
          stlset /type
          stlacon /type

  Types for stlmap and stlset. stlacon includes stlmap and stlset.

.. type stlmap_iter /type
        stlset_iter /type
        stlacon_iter /type

  Types for iterators on a stlmap or stlset. stlacon_iter includes stlmap_iter
  and stlset_iter.

.. type stlacon_rng /type

  A range of elements defined on a stlmap or stlset.


The stlmmap Module
------------------

If you need a multi-keyed container, stlmmap and stlmset, provided by the
stlmmap module, are your only choices. Set operations and ranges are
supported, but the semantics are more complicated than is the case for stlmap
and stlset. Iterator caching by key oriented functions is not provided because
the keys are not unique. For the same reason, the key oriented functions might
are less than ideal when dealing with multi-keyed containers. Using the
pure-stlmap iterator interface might be your best choice.

You can import the stlmmap module by adding the following using statement to
your code. ::

  > using stlmmap;

Importing the stlmmap module introduces types to describe stlmmap and stlmset,
along with their iterators and ranges defined on them.

.. type:: stlmmap /type
          stlmset /type
          stlmacon /type

  Types for stlmmap and stlmset. stlmacon includes stlmmap and stlmset.

 .. type stlmmap_iter /type
        stlmset_iter /type
        stlmacon_iter /type

  Types for iterators on stlmmap and stlmset. stlacon_iter includes
  stlmmap_iter and stlmset_iter.

.. type stlmacon_rng /type

  Type for a range of elements defined on a stlmmap or stlmset.

Blurb on how to get at elements by key, never by (key=>val)


The stlhmap Module
------------------

If all you want is quick lookup and you don't need ranges, stlhmap and
stlhset, provided by the stlhmap module might be slightly faster than stlmap
and stlset. Set operations, ranges and iterator caching are not available for
these containers,

You can import the stlmmap module by adding the following using statement to
your code. ::

  > using stlhmap;

Importing the stlmap module introduces types to describe stlhmap and
stlhset.

.. type:: stlhmap /type
          stlhset /type
          stlhacon /type

Container Operations
====================

As mentioned, each of the six associative containers supported by pure-stlmap
has its own set of unique characteristics. On the other hand, they all share
..  So attempt is made to describe each function for all. If follow natural
instincts it should not be hard as it sounds.

Container Construction and Related Operations
---------------------------------------------

New empty containers can be constructed using optional parameters that allow
you to specify customized key-less-than functions, default values,
value-less-than and value-equal functions for the ordered associative
containers (stlmap, stlset, stlmmap and stlmset) as well as hash, key-equal
and value-equal functions for the unordered associatived containers (stlhmap
and stlhset).

.. namespace:: ::

.. function:: mkstlmap (kcmp,dflt,vcmp,veql)
              mkstlmmap (kcmp,vcmp,veql)
              mkstlset kcmp
              mkstlmset kcmp
              mkstlhmap (khash,keql,veql)
              mkstlhset (khash,keql)

   Create a new associative container. The key comparison and hash functions,
   kcmp and khash, are required, the other parameters are optional. The
   functions vcmp and veql are used to determine if one value is less than
   another or equal to another, respectively. The function keql is used to
   determine if one key is equal to another. The object dflt is a the
   containers default value. The default values for dflt, vcmp, veql and keql
   are [], (<) (==) and (==) respectively. E.g., ::

   > let xx = mkstlhmap hash;
   > container_info xx;
   0,2,0.0,1.0,hash,(==),(==)

   > let xx = mkstlmap (>);
   > container_info xx;
   0,(>),[],(<),(==)

Convenience functions are provided to construct empty containers using default
values.

.. function:: emptystlmap
              emptystlmmap
              emptystlset
              emptystlmset
              emptystlhmap
              emptystlhset

   Create a new associative container using default values.

Convenience functions are also provided to construct an empty container and
insert elements into it in one go. The source of the elements can be a list,
vector, a stlvec, or a range defined on another container of the same type as
the new container.

.. function:: stlmap /stlmap src
              stlmmap /stlmmap src
              stlset /stlmap src
              stlmset /stlmmap src
              stlhmap /stlhmap src
              stlhset /stlhmap src

   Create an associative constructor using default values and insert elements
   from src. src can be a list, vector, stlvec or a range defined over a
   container of the same type as the new container. If the new container is
   one of the three maps, the elements of src must be (k=>v) hash-rocket
   pairs.

After a stlhmap or stlhset is created, it is possible to adjust its maximum
load factor and bucket count.

.. namespace:: stl

.. function:: hash_reserve hacon mlf size

   Sets hacon's max_load_factor to mlf, sets the number of buckets to size/mlf
   and rehashes hacon.

.. function:: container_info /stlmmap acon

   If acon is an ordered associative container, returns (is_set, kcmp, dflt,
   vcmp, veql). If is set is true, dflt, vcmp, and veql will be random values
   that should not be used. If acon is unordered, returns (is_set,
   bucket_count, load_factor, max_load_factor, khash, keql, veql), where veql
   has no meaning if is_set is true.

..function:: swap /stlmap acon1 acon2

  Swap the elements of the two containers of the same type.

.. function:: empty /stlmap acon

  Return true if acon is empty, else false.

.. namespace:: ::

.. function:: prefix # /stlmap acon

  Return the number of elements in acon.

Equality and Comparison
-----------------------

Two associative containers of the same type are considered to be equal if they
contain the same number of elements and if each pair of their corresponding
elements are equal.

.. namespace:: 

.. function:: equal /stlmap rng1 rng2

.. function:: infix == /stlmap rng1 rng2
              infix ~= /stlmap rng1 rng2

  Test rng1 and rng2 for equality or nonequality where rng1 and rng2 are
  ranges defined over containers of the same type. ::
 
   > let xx = stlset ss;
   > xx == ss;
   1

Please note that the == defined on all tuples in the prelude will trump
pure-stlmap's == operators when applied to range tuples. E.g.::

   > stl::elms ss;
   ["a","b","c","d","e"]

   > let xx  = stl::stlset  ["a","b","c","d"];

   > stl::equal (xx,"a","c") (ss,"a","c");
   1

   > (xx,"a","c") == (ss,"a","c");
   0

Thus, for ranges, use equal rather than ==. This issue does not arrise for
the other comparison operators such as (<).

.. function:: infix <  /stlmap rng1 rng2

   Traverse the ranges comparing pairs of elements e1 and e2. If e1 is less
   than e2, stop and return true; if e2 is less than e1 then stop and return
   false. If rng1 is exhausted but rng2 is not, return true, else return false. 
   The two ranges must be defined on ordered associative containers of the
   same type.

.. function:: infix >  /stlmap rng1 rng2
              infix <= /stlmap rng1 rng2
              infix >= /stlmap rng1 rng2

  The these three operators are the same as rng2 < rng2, ~(rng1>rng2) and
  ~(rng1<rng2) respectively.

You have to be extra careful when using equivalence and comparison operators
with stlmmaps because elements with the same key and different values are not
necessarily ordered by values. ::

    > let smm2 = stlmmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>32,"c"=>31,"d"=>4];

    > elms smm;
    ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4]

    > elms smm2;
    ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>32,"c"=>31,"d"=>4]

    > smm == smm2; // probably not what you want
    0 

These operations do not make much sense for a stlmmap unless the equivalent
keys are stored in the order enfored by the stlmmap's value-comp
function. Check your implementation to see if it is even possible to control
the order (C++11 is ok). Please note that the comparison operators are not
provided for unordered containers.

Key Oriented Functions
----------------------

.. namespace:: stl

Most of the following functions are basically convenience functions that are
easier to use than iterators. They use cached iterators for faster lookup time
for some commonly occurring sequences of operations.

.. function:: count /stlmap acon k
              has_key /stlmap acon k

   Returns the number of elements that has k as their key.

.. function:: has_key /stlmap acon k

   Returns true if acon contains an element that has k as its key.    

.. function infix ! /stlmap acon k

  If acon is not a stlmmap then if acon has an element with key k return its
  value (or matching key if acon is a set), otherwise throw an out_of_bounds
  exception. If acon is a stlmmap then if acon has as least one element with
  key k return a list of values of all the elements with key k, otherwise
  return an empty list. E.g.::

    > sm!"c";
    3

    > catch id $ sm!"f";
    out_of_bounds

    > smm!"c";
    [31,32]

    > smm!"f";  // does not throw exception -- returns empty list
    []

.. function:: get /stlmap (acon,k)

   Same as (!) except that it returns a key value(s) pair instead of a value.

   > get (sm,smbeg);
   "a"=>1

   > get (smm,"c");
   "c"=>[31,32]

   > get (smm,smbeg);
   "a"=>[1]

.. function:: put /stlmap (uniq_map,k) v
              put /stlmap (multi_map,k) src

   Associate v with k (i.e., insert (k=>v)) in uniq_map where uniq_map is a
   stlmap or stlhmap, or associate the elements of src with k in a in
   multi_map, where multi_is a stlmmap. src can be a list or a vector. The
   elements associated with k in multi_map are placed in the same order as
   they appear in src. src can be empty.

   > elms smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > put (smm,"c") [31,33,35,36];
   4

   > elms smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>33,"c"=>35,"c"=>36,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > put (smm,"c") [];
   0

   > elms smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

.. function:: bounding_keys /stlmap rng

   Return a pair of keys, first and last, such that first <= k < last for each
   k, where k is the key of an element in rng. If there is no such last, the
   second member of the returned pair will be stl::smend. If first is the key
   of the first element of rng's container, the first member of the returned
   pair will stl::smbeg. E.g.,

   > elms sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > bounding_keys sm;
   stl::smbeg,stl::smend

  > bounding_keys (sm,"a1","e");
   "b","e"

   > elms (sm,ans);
   ["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4]

   > bounding_keys (smm,"a","d");
   stl::smbeg,"d"

   > elms (smm,ans);
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32]

.. function:: next_key /stlmap oc k
              prev_key /stlmap oc k

   next_key returns the key of the first element in oc, an ordered associative
   container, that has a key that is greater than k. If no such element exists
   or if k is stl::smend, returns stl::smend. prev_key returns the last
   element in oc that has a key that is less that k, or, if no such element
   exists, throws an out_of_bounds execption. If k is not smbeg, smend or an
   element of oc, out_of_bounds exception.

Iterator Cache
--------------

stlmaps and stlsets maintain a cache of iterators that are updated by all of
the key oriented functions described in the previous section. In addition,
insert (of a single element), insert_or_update, and insert_or_update_with also
cache iterators. [FIX -- is this correct?]

Here are some examples produced by compiling pure-stlmap with a trace function
that shows when caching eliminates a key lookup.

   > has_key sm "a";
   1

   > sm!"a";
   found iterator for: "a"
   1

   > put (sm,"a") 10;
   found iterator for: "a"
   10

   > let k = next_key sm "a";
   found iterator for: "a"

   > let k = next_key sm k;
   found iterator for: "b"

   > put (sm,k) 30;
   found iterator for: "c"
   30

   > elms sm;
   ["a"=>10,"b"=>2,"c"=>30,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

In particular, using has_key followed by a get or put only requires one
lookup. Also, traversing a range with next_key (or prev_key) followed by gets
and puts can be accomplished in linear time (i.e., next_key requires constant
time, assuming the current key is cached, as do put or get after next_key
caches its result). Currently the four most recently accessed iterators are
cached.

Range Access
------------

These functions access ranges defined on ordered containers. They work on the
unordered containers (stlhmap and stlhset) only if range is the entire
container.

.. function:: members /stlmap rng
              elms /stlmap rng
              keys /stlmap rng
              vals /stlmap rng

  members and elms Return a list of the elments in the range, rng. keys and
  vals return the keys and vals of the ranges elements. E.g.,::

    > elms shm;   // cannot do (shm,k1,k2)
   ["d"=>4,"e"=>5,"a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3]

   > keys (sm,"b","e");
   ["b","c","d"]

   > vals (sm,"b","e");
   [2,3,4]

.. function:: vector /stlmap rng
              stlvec /stlmap rng

  Return a vector or stlvec containing the elments of in the range, rng. E.g.,
  ::

.. function:: stream /stlmap rng
              lazy_map f rng

  These are lazy versions of (elms rng) and (map f rng). E.g., ::

   > take 3 $ stream smm;
   ("a"=>1):#<thunk 0xb70f438c>

   > list ans;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31]

.. function range_info /stlmap rng

   Returns a tuple (ok, sac, first, last) where ok is true if the range is
   valid, sac is the container that the range points into, and first and last
   are iterators that define the range. E.g., ::

   > let ok, smx, f, l = stl::range_info (sm1,"b","e");

   > ok, smx === sm1, stl::elms (f,l);
   1,1,["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4]

.. function:: distance /stlmap rng

   Returns the number of elements contained in rng where rng is a range
   defined on an associative container.

Insertion, Erasure and Updating
-------------------------------

Elements can be inserted into associative containers en masse from another
container or individually. In either case, if an item is about to be inserted
in a unique key associative container (stlmap, stlset, stlhmap, stlhset), the
element will not be inserted if the its key is already stored in the target
container. Please note that this behavior is the opposite to that the Pure
standard library's insert which would update the old element to match the
element being inserted.

Of course elements are always inserted into multi key associative
containers. Note also that keys can be equivalent for these purposes even if
they are not equal in other respects. E.g., a set's less than function might
only depend on a particular field of records that are inserted into it.

..function:: insert /stlmap acon src

  Tries to insert elements in a valid "insert source" into an associative
  container, and then returns the number of elements inserted. A valid "insert
  source" is a list, vector, stlvec, or a range over an associative container
  of the same type as acon. If acon is an associative map (stlmap, stlmmap or
  stlhmap), the elements of src must be key value pairs of the form (k=>v).

..function:: insert /stlmap acon elm

  If acon is an associative map and elm is a key value pair, (k=>v), attempts
  to insert (k=>v) into acon.  If acon is an associative set, and elm is not a
  valid insert source, attempts to insert elm into acon. If acon is a
  multi-keyed container, returns an iterator pointing to the element with key
  k that was just inserted. If acon is uniquely keyed, returns a pair, the
  first of which is an iterator pointing to the element with key k that was
  just inserted (or the pre-existing element that blocked the insertion). The
  second element in the pair is a boolean value that is true if a new element
  was inserted.

..function:: insert /stlmap acon (elm,p)

  This is the same as the previous function except that (a) p is passed in as
  a hint to where the new element should be inserted and (b) a single iterator
  is returned rather than a iterator,boolean pair. If the new element is
  inserted just after p, the insertion can have constant time complexity.

..function:: insert_elm s elm

  s must be an associative set. This is the same as insert s elm, except that
  insert_elm will attempt to insert elm into s even if it is a valid insert
  source (i.e., lists, vectors, etc., can be inserted in s).

Here are some insert examples::

   > let smx  = emptystlmap;
   > insert smx {"a"=>1,"b"=>2}; elms smx;
   2
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2]

   > let p, ok = insert smx ("a"=>2); get p,ok; // will not update "a"
   "a"=>1,0

   > put p 2 $ elms smx;  // used iterator p to update "a"'s value to 2
   ["a"=>2,"b"=>2]

   > let smmx = emptystlmmap;
   > insert smmx {"a"=>1,"b"=>2};
     2

   > let p = insert smmx ("a"=>2); get p; // returns iterator only
   "a"=>2

   > elms smmx;
   ["a"=>1,"a"=>2,"b"=>2]

The next two functions can be used to insert new items and update existing
items in an associative map. They return the map rather than the number of
elements inserted so that they can be used with foldl or foldr to insert
elements from another container. In essence, insert_or_update is acts like
the Pure standard library's insert function when applied to a dict or hdict.

..function:: insert_or_update acon elm

  If acon is a map, elm must be a key value pair, (k=>v); if it is a set, then
  elm can be anything, where elm is treated as its own key, k. If acon is
  multi-keyed (i.e., stlmmap, or stlmset), insert elm. If acon is a uniquely
  keyed map (i.e., a stlmap, stlhmp) insert elm unless there is an element in
  acon with key equivalent/equal to k. If there is such an element, change its
  value to v. If acon is a uniquely keyed set (i.e., stlset or stlhset),
  insert elm only if acon does not already have an elm that is equal to
  elm. Returns acon. E.g.,::

   > let src = ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"c"=>4,"c"=>5];

   > elms $ foldl insert_or_update emptystlmmap src;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"c"=>4,"c"=>5]

   > elms $ foldl insert_or_update emptystlmap src;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>5]

..function:: insert_or_update_with f m (k=>v)

  This function only applies to stlmaps. The effect of this function is as
  follows: (a) if ~has_key m k then insert m (k=>dflt) else (), where dflt is
  m's dflt value, (b) put (m,k) nv when nv = f v (m!k) end. Returns m. E.g.,

   > let src = ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"c"=>4,"c"=>5];

   > let lists = foldl (insert_or_update_with (:)) emptystlmap src;
   > elms lists;
   ["a"=>[1],"b"=>[2],"c"=>[5,4,3]]

   > let sums = foldl (insert_or_update_with (+)) (mkstlmap ((<),0)) src;
   > elms sums;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>12]

..function:: erase /stlmap acon
             erase /stlmap (acon,k)
             erase /stlmap (acon,i)
             erase /stlmap (acon,k1,k2)
             erase /stlmap (acon,i,j)

  The first form erases all elements in acon. The second erases all elements
  with key equivalent to k. The third erases the element pointed by the
  iterator i. The fourth erases the elements in the range (acon,k1,k2). The
  fifth form erases the elements in the range (i,j), assuming i and j are
  iterators on acon. Note that the fourth and fifth forms only apply to the
  ordered containers, not stlhmap or stlhset (because ranges and iterators are
  not defined for stlhmap or stlhset). Returns the number of elements removed
  from the container. E.g.,::

   > elms smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]
   > erase (sm,"z");
   0
   > erase (smm,"c");
   2
   > elms smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > erase (smm,"b","e");
   2
   > elms smm;;
   ["a"=>1,"e"=>5]

   > elms ss;
   ["a","b","c","d","e"]
   > let _,_,i,j = range_info (ss,"b","e");
   > erase (ss,i,j);
   3
   > elms ss;
   ["a","e"]

List-Like Operations
====================

pure-stlmap provides the most commonly used list-like operations, implemented
to act directly on the underlying data structures. Additional list like
operations, such as scanl, can be simulated by using elms (or stream) to
produce a list of elements and then applying the operation to the list.

The first two rows of "standard" list-like operations are applicable all six
associative containers while the last row is applicable only to the ordered
containers.

   * do, map, listmap, catmap, foldl, foldl1

   * rowmap, rowcatmap, colmap, colcatmap

   * foldr, foldr1, filter

Except for their domain, ranges defined on associative containers, these
functions are the same as the corresponding list functions in the Pure
standard Library. E.g.,

   > elms sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > map (\(k=>v)->k+str v) (sm,"b","e");
   ["b2","c3","d4"]

   > foldr1 (\(k=>v) (ks=>sum)-> (k+ks=>v+sum)) (sm,"b","e");
   "bcd"=>9

   > filter (\(k=>v)->v mod 2) sm;
   ["a"=>1,"c"=>3,"e"=>5]

The list functions provided are sufficient to support list and matrix
comprehensions. ::

   > [ k + str v | (k=>v) = (sm,"b","e")];
   ["b2","c3","d4"]

   > [ k=>v | (k=>v) = sm; v mod 2];
   ["a"=>1,"c"=>3,"e"=>5]

   > { {k;v} |  (k=>v) = sm; v mod 2};
   {"a","c","e";1,3,5}


Set Algorithms
==============

pure-stlmap provides wrappers for the STL set algorithms that apply to ranges
defined on the four ordered associative containers. These algorithms are very
efficient, with linear time complexity, but they do require that the elements
of the two ranges are ordered. Accordingly, the set algorithms are not
applicable to stlhmap or stlhset. Also, when dealing with stlmmaps care must
be taken to ensure that items with the same key are ordered by their
values. If this is not possible, it might be better to use a stlmap with
buckets for values (with appropriately customized less-than and equal
operators).

When applied to the multi-keyed containers, stlmmap and stlmset, these
operations do not necessarily produce the same results as their Pure standard
library counter parts. In particular, when applied to multi-keyed contaners,
set_union is multiset union while (+) in the Pure standard library is the
multiset sum. If you want the multiset sum of a stlmmap or stlhmap, use merge.

..function:: merge /stlmap rng1 rng2

  Construct a new ordered container from rng1 and then insert rng2 and return
  it. rng1 and rng2 must be defined on the same type of ordered container.

..function:: set_union /stlmap rng1 rng2
             set_difference /stlmap rng1 rng2
             set_intersection /stlmap rng1 rng2
             set difference of rng1 and rng2
             set_symmetric_difference /stlmap rng1 rng2
             set difference of rng1 and rng2 as a new sac
             set_includes /stlmap rng1 rng2

   Returns a new ordered associative container of the same type as the ordered
   containers underlying rng1 and rng2. If the ranges are defined over a
   stlmap or stlmmap elements of rng1 have priority over the elments of rng2.

Please note that in pure-stlmap, the left hand set has priority of elements
while in the Pure standard library the right hand set has priority of
elements. Here are some examples that show how these operations differ from
those in the Pure standard library. ::

   > let smm1 = stlmmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32];
   > let smm2 = stlmmap ["c"=>32,"c"=>32,"c"=>33,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];

   > elms $ merge smm1 smm2; // three "c"=>32
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"c"=>32,"c"=>32,"c"=>33,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > elms $ set_union smm1 smm2;  // two "c"=>32
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"c"=>32,"c"=>33,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > let sm1 = stlmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31];
   > let sm2 = stlmap ["c"=>32,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];

   > elms $ set_union sm1 sm2; // "c"=>31 from sm1, not "c"=>32 from sm2
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > elms $ set_intersection sm1 sm2; // "c"=>31 from sm1
   ["c"=>31]


Iterator Interface
==================

Iterator support is provided only for the ordered associative containers,
stlmap, stlset, stlmmap and stlmset. 

Exceptions
----------

In pure-stlmap functions that accept iterators throw a bad_argument exception
if called with an invalid iterator. An iterator remains valid until the
element it was pointing to has been erased. These functions also attempt to
throw bad argument exceptions for bad uses that would otherwise result in
undefined behavior. An example of an invalid use would be a range specified by
iterators from different containers. Here are some examples of iterator
errors. ::


   > let i,j = find sm "a", find sm "d";

   > get i, get j;
   "a"=>1,"d"=>4

   > elms (i,j);
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3]

   > catch id $ elms (j,i); // j and i transposed, C++ would segfault
   bad_argument

   > erase (sm,"b");  // erase "b"=>2, leaving i and j valid
   1

   > get i; // still valid
   "a"=>1

   > erase (sm,"a");  // erase "a"=>1 - invalidating i
   1

   > catch id $ get i; // bad iterator exception
   bad_argument


Functions
---------

The functions in this section never cache iterators, on the assumption that if
you call them you are not using the key-oriented functions. [FIX -- change?]

..function:: iterator /stlmap i
             begin /stlmap acon
             pastend /stlmap acon

  Return a new iterator that points to the same element as i, or return
  acon's begin or past-end iterator.

..function:: find /stlmap acon k
 
  Create a new iterator that points to the element with key equivalent to k or
  acon's past-end iterator if none exists.

..function:: lower_bound /stlmap acon k

  Return a new iterator that points to the first element in acon that is not
  less than k, or acon's past-end iterator if none exists.
 
..function:: upper_bound /stlmap acon k

  Return a new iterator that points to the first element in acon that is
  greater than k, or acon's past-end iterator if none exists.
 
..function:: equal_range /stlmap acon k

  Return the pair lower_bound acon k, upper_bound acon k.

..function:: inc /stlmap iter
             dec /stlmap iter
             move /stlmap iter n
  
  Move iter forward one, back one or forward n elements respectively, where n
  can be negative.  The iterator us mutated by these operations, provided the
  move is successful. An attempt to move to a position before the first
  element's position causes a out-of-bounds exception. Moves past the last
  element return the acon's past-end iterator

..function:: get /stlmap i
             get_key i
             get_val i

  Return the element pointed to by the iterator i, or the element's key or
  value. For maps the element is returned as a key=>value hash rocket
  pair. For sets, get_elem, get_key and get_val all return the element (which
  is the same as its key).

..function:: put_val i newvalue

  Change the value of the element pointed to by i to newvalue. The element's
  key cannot be changed. The iterator must point into a map, not a set.

..function:: is_begin /stlmap i
             is_pastend /stlmap i

  Returns true if the iterator i is it's acon's begin iterator or its pastend
  iterator.

..function:: get_info /stlmap i

  Returns a tuple (is_valid,acon,key,val) where is_valid is true if the
  iterator i is valid or false if not, acon is the acon that i points into,
  and key, val are the key and value of the element i points to, if any. If i
  is the past-end iterator, key and value are FIX.

.. function:: infix == /stlmap i j
   
   Returns true if the iterators i and j point to the same element.

 .. function:: infixr ^ /stlmap m k

   Returns an iterator pointing to the element in m, a stlmap, with key k. If
   no such element existed before the call, one is created using map's default
   value.

Here are some examples using iterators. 

   > let b,e = begin smm, pastend smm;

   > elms (b,e);
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > let i,j = equal_range smm "c";

   > elms (b,i);
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2]

   > elms (i,j);
   ["c"=>31,"c"=>32]

   > elms (j,e);
   ["d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > get i;
   "c"=>31

   > get (inc i);
   "c"=>32

   > put i 132;
   132

   > map (\(k=>_)->k=>ord k) (b,i);
   ["a"=>97,"b"=>98,"c"=>99]

   > let is_set, smm1, k, v = get_info i; is_set, elms smm1, k, v;
   1,["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>132,"d"=>4,"e"=>5],"c",132

   > get (dec j);
   "c"=>132

   > inc j $$ inc j $$ get j;
   "e"=>5

   > inc j $$ is_pastend j;
   1
