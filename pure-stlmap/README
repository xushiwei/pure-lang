Introduction
============

Supported Containers
--------------------

A part of the Standard C++ Library`_ that is often refered to as the standard
template library ("STL") provides templates for generic containers and generic
algorithms. pure-stlmap provides six mutable containers "stlmap", "stlset",
"stlmmap", "stlmset", "stlhmap" and "stlhset" that are thin wrappers around
the corresponding associative containers provided by the STL: map, set,
multimap, multiset, unordered_map and unordered_set. pure-stlmap does not 
provide wrappers for unordered_multimap and unordered_multiset. In addition,
the interfaces for stlhmap and stlhset are limited compared to those provided
for the other four (ordered) associative containers.

Function Interface
------------------

Many of the functions provided by pure-stlmap, such as the constructors,
equivalence and lexicographical comparison operations, insert and erase
operations, and the set operations are just thin wrappers around the the
corresponding C++ functions. Users can consult the C++ Library documentation
to understand the performance characteristics and corner case behavior of any
pure-stlmap function that has a corresponding function in the STL.

For the ordered containers, stlmap, stlmmap, stlset and stlmset, pure-stlmap
provides an interator-based interface that corresponds to the C++ interface on
a one-to-one basis. In a addition, they provide a higher level key-based
interface that that is much easier to use. The key-based interface includes
all the core functional programming operations that apply to lists, including
map, foldl, do, filter and list comprehensions. The key-based operations act
on a range (i.e., subsequence) of the ordered container as well as on the
entire container.

The interface for the unordered or "hash table" containers, stlhmap and
stlhset, is limited compared to that provided for the ordered containers. In
particular iterators, ranges and set operations are not supported. 

The STL's associative containers have different semantics than the
corresponding containers provided by the Pure standard library. Where there is
a conflict, pure-stlmap follows the STL.

The C++ library is sometimes more complicated than the Pure Standard
Library. For example many of the applicable C++ functions, including set
operations and tests for equality assume that the containers are
lexicographically ordered. The reward for playing by the rules (which occurs
automatically for stlmap and stlset) is O(n) time complexity for comparison
and set operations.

pure_stlmap_functions.pdf
----------------------

The pure-stlmap/examples directory includes a summary,
pure_stlmap_functions.pdf, of all of the functions provided by stlmap, stlmmap
and stlhmap, as well as all of the functions provided by stlvec.

Installation
============

pure-stlmap-@version@ requires at least Pure 0.48. The latest version of Pure
is available at http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/downloads/list.

The latest version of the source code for pure-stlmap can be downloaded from
http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/pure-stlmap-@version@.tar.gz.
 
To install pure-stlmap (on Linux), extract the source code (e.g., tar -xzf
pure-stlmap-@version@.tar.gz), cd to the pure-stlmap-@version@ directory, and
run ``make``. After this you can (and should) also run ``make test`` to run a
few test scripts to make sure that pure-stlmap works properly on your system. If
``make test`` works, run ``sudo make install`` to install pure-stlmap on your
system.  ``make`` tries to guess your Pure installation directory and
platform-specific setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables
manually. In particular, ``make install prefix=/usr`` sets the installation
prefix. Please see the Makefile for details.

Usage
=====

After installation of pure-stlmap, you can use the operations of this package
by placing one or more the following import declarations in your Pure
programs::

  using stlmap;
  using stlmmap;
  using stlhmap;

If you import stlmap, stlmmap or stlhmap but not stlvec, you will still be
able to produce a stlvec that contains the elements of a given stlmap, but you
will not be able to access the stlvec's members. ::

   > let sm  = stlmap  ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]; // make a stlmap

   > let sv = stlvec sm;  // make a stlvec

   > sv!3;                // fails, (!) not defined for stlvecs
   STLVEC #<pointer 0xa546978>!3

   > using stlvec;        // now (!) is defined for stlvecs
   > sv!3;
   "d"=>4




Examples
========

Some short example programs are provided in the pure-stlmap/examples
subdirectory. The pure-stlmap/uts subdirectory constains Pure scripts that are
used to test pure-stlmap. These scripts consist of a line of code followed by
a comment that contains the expected output. E.g., ::

   let sm1 = stlmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];
   //- ()

   sm1!stl::smbeg, sm1!"a", sm1!"d", sm1!"e"
   //- 1,1,4,5

   catch id $ sm1!"0";
   //- out_of_bounds

You might consider pasting parts of these scripts into a temporary file that
you can play with if you are curious about how something works.

The code snippets that appear in the examples that follow, including those
accompanying the documentation of functions, assume that something similar to
the following has been entered at the prompt. ::

   pure-stlmap$> pure -q
   > using stlmap, stlhmap, stlmmap;
   > using namespace stl;

   > // Make some maps and sets with default characteristics
   > let sm  = stlmap  ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];
   > let shm = stlhmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];
   > let smm = stlmmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];
   > let ss  = stlset  ["a","b","c","d","e"];
   > let shs = stlhset ["a","b","c","d","e"];
   > let sms = stlmset ["a","b","c","c","d"];

The file "readme-data.pure", which can be found in the pure-stlmap/examples
directory, contains the corresponding source code.

Quick Start
===========

Hopefully, a quick read of these examples should get you up and running with
pure-stlmap. If you want to try things out as you go, start up Pure, run
readme-data.pure, and use the members function to make sure things are
ok. E.g., ::

   $> cd pure-stlmap/examples/
   /home/ps/Downloads/pure-lang/pure-stlmap/examples

   $> pure -q
   > run readme-data.pure 
   > members sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

Constructors and Insertion
--------------------------

You can make empty containers with customized orderings, etc., as well as with
default values. ::

   > let ss1 = mkstlset (>);  // uses (>) to order elements

   > let sm1 = emptystlmap;   // uses default, (<), to order keys

You can insert elements and (for maps) replace their values using the insert,
replace and insert_or_replace functions. ::

   > insert sm1 ("e"=>5);              // returns number of elements inserted
   1
   > members sm1;
   ["e"=>5]

   > replace sm1 "e" 15;               // returns value
   15
   > members sm1;
   ["e"=>15]

   > catch id $ replace sm1 "x" 10;    // replace never inserts new elements
   out_of_bounds

   > insert sm1 ("e"=>25);             // insert never changes values
   0
   > members sm1;
   ["e"=>15]

   > insert_or_replace sm1 ("e"=>25);  // insert_or_replace is like "update"
   1                                   // in the Pure standard library  
   > members sm1;
   ["e"=>25]
   >

The insert and insert_or_replace are overloaded to insert or replace elements
specified in a list, vector, stlvec or another pure-stlmap container (of the
same type). E.g., ::

   > insert ss1 ss;                    // insert all 5 of ss's elements
   5
   > members ss1;
   ["e","d","c","b","a"]

   > insert ss1 ("d".."g");            // only "f" and "g" were inserted
   2
   > members ss1;
   ["g","f","e","d","c","b","a"]

Here is an insertion example for a stlmap. ::

   > let sm2 = emptystlmap;

   > insert sm2 ["b"=>2,"a"=>1];       // insert from a list
   2
   > members sm2;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2]

   > insert sm2 (sm,"c","e");          // insert from a range
   2
   > members sm2;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4]

   > insert_or_replace sm2 {"a"=>11,"e"=>15};
   2
   > members sm2;
   ["a"=>11,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>15]

Erasing Elements
----------------

You can use the erase function to remove all the elements associated with a
given key from a container, all of the elements in a container or all of the
elements in subsequence of elements in a container. ::

   > let shm1 = stlhmap shm;       // make some copies of a stlhmap
   > let smm1 = stlmmap smm;
   > let sm1 = stlmap sm;

   > erase (shm1,"c");             // erase elmenent with key "c"
   1
   > members shm1;
   ["d"=>4,"e"=>5,"a"=>1,"b"=>2]

   > erase shm1;                   // erase all elements
   4
   > null shm1;
   1

   > erase (sm1,"b","d");         // erase a subsequence       
   2
   > members sm1;
   ["a"=>1,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > erase (sm1,"x");             // attempt to erase something not there
   0

   > erase (smm1,"c");            // erase all elements with key "c"
   2
   > members smm1;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

Access
------

The value (or values for a multi-key container) associated with a key can be
accessed using the (!) operator. ::

   > sm!"a";   // return value associated with "a"
   1

   > shm!"b";  // try it with a hashed map
   2

   > smm!"c";  // multimap returns a list of values for "c"
   [31,32]

   > ss!"a";   // with sets, return the key
   "a"

   > sms!"c";  // with multisets, return a list of keys
   ["c","c"]

If the key is not stored in the container, (!) throws an out_of_bounds
exception.

   > catch id $ sm!"x"; // "x" is not stored as a key in sm
   out_of_bounds

If you want to see if a key is stored in a container use the member
function. ::

   > member sm "x";
   0

   > member sm "a";
   1

When applied to a stlmap or stlset, the member function caches the C++
iterator that it uses to make the test. That way, subsequent access from, or a
replace or insert to the same location in the map can be done in constant time
as opposed to O(log n) time. E.g., ::

   > inc_sum m k v = if member m k then replace m k (m!k + v) 
                     else insert m k v;

   > let sm1 = emptystlmap;

   > inc_sum sm1 "a" 1;
   1

   > inc_sum sm1 "a" 5;
   6

   > members sm1;
   ["a"=>6]

When inc_sum is called the first time, there will be an O(log n) look up when
member is called, and a constant time look up for the insert. All the rest of
the calls to member, (!) and replace use constant time lookups.

For maps (stlmap, stlhmap and stlmmap) you can retrieve an element's key and
value using the get function. ::

   > get (sm,"b");
   "b"=>2

   > get (smm,"c");
   "c"=>[31,32]

Conversions
-----------

The elements of an ordered container (stlmap, stlset, stlmmap and stlmset) or
a subsequence of its elements can be copied to a list using the members
funcion. The same is true for unordered containers (stlhmap and stlhset) as
well except that subsequences are not supported. ::

   > members ss;
   ["a","b","c","d","e"]

   > members (ss,"b","d"); // list subsequence from "b" up to but not "d" 
   ["b","c"]

   > members (smm,"c","e");
   ["c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4]
   
   > members (shm,"b","d"); // fails - ranges not supported for stlhmaps
   stl::members (#<pointer 0x83b4908>,"b","d")

   > members shm;          // ok - the entire stlhmap is treated as a range 
   ["d"=>4,"e"=>5,"a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3]

Please note that the last element in the range specification is not included
in the range. Also, ranges are not supported for stlhmap and stlhset.

Similarly, the elements can be copied to a Pure vector or stlvec. ::

   > stl::vector (sm,smbeg,"d");
   {"a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3}

   > using stlvec;
   > members $ stlvec sm; 
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

Functional Programming List Operations
--------------------------------------

Most of the Pure list operations, including map, do, filter, catmap, foldl and
foldl1 can be applied to pure-stlmap's associative containers. E.g., ::

   > map (\x->x-32) shs;
   ["D","E","A","B","C"]

   > using system;

   > do (puts . str) (sm,smbeg,"c");
   "a"=>1
   "b"=>2
   ()

   > let sm1 = foldl insert_or_replace (mkstlmap (>)) (sm,"c",smend);
   > members sm1;
   ["e"=>5,"d"=>4,"c"=>3]

List comprehensions also work. ::

   > [k-32=>v+100 | (k=>v) = smm; k>"a" && k<"e"];
   ["B"=>102,"C"=>131,"C"=>132,"D"=>104]

   > {k-32=>v+100 | (k=>v) = (smm,"b","e")};
   {"B"=>102,"C"=>131,"C"=>132,"D"=>104}

Note that the functional programming list operations work directly on the
underlying data structure. 

Streams
-------

You can access an associative containers elements (or a subrange of its
elements if the container is ordered) as a stream. E.g.,

   > stats -m

   > let ss1 = stlhset (0..100000);
   0.19s, 300006 cells

   > let xx = drop 99998 $ scanl (+) 0 (stream ss);
   0.3s, 18 cells

   > list xx;
   [704782707,704882705,704982704,705082704]
   0s, 17 cells


Fundamentals - Containers, Iterators, Ranges and Their Elements
===============================================================

This section describes the objects and concepts that underly
pure-stlmap. These include the supported containers, iterators, ranges,
elements, keys, values and a group of functions that help define a container's
behavior.

Containers
----------

The six associative containers supported by pure-stlmap can be grouped
together in terms of certain defining attributes. 

  * associative container - stlmap, stlset, stlmmap, stlmmset, stlhmap or
                            stlhset

  * ordered container - stlmap, stlset, stlmmap, stlmmset

  * unique-keyed container - stlmap, stlset, stlhmap, stlhset

  * multi-keyed container - stlmmap, stlmset

  * unordered container - stlhmap, stlhset

  * map - stlmap, stlmmap, stlhmap

  * ordered map - stlmap, stlmmap

  * unique-keyed map - stlmap, stlhmap

  * multi-keyed map - stlmmap

  * unordered map - stlhmap
  
  * set - stlset, stlmset, stlhset

  * ordered set - stlset, stlmset

  * unique-keyed set - stlset, stlhset

  * multi-keyed set - stlmset

  * unordered set - stlhset

Hopefully these names are intuitive enough that defining them here was not
really necessary. On the other hand, the groupings do summarize what is
available in this package.

Keys, Values and Elements
-------------------------

The three maps provided by pure-stlmap (stlmap, stlmmap and stlhmap) associate
values with keys. If a value v is associated with a key, k, in an map, m, then
we say that (k=>v) is an element of m and that k is stored in m. The three
sets provided by pure-stlmap (stlset, stlmset and stlhset) simply hold single
elements, as opposed to key value pairs. If an element e is contained a set,
s, we say that e is an element of s, that e is stored in s, that s has key e
and that s has value e. In other words, we sometimes speak of a set as if it
were a map where each element, key and value are the same object.

For those that want to refer to the C++ documentation, stlmap is (essentially)
map<px*,px*>, stlmmap is multimap<px*,px*> and stlhmap is
unordered_map<px*,px*>, where px is defined by "typedef pure_expr px". I.e.,
in C++ Containers library speak, key_type is px*, mapped_type is px* and
value_type is pair<px*,px*>. This might be a bit confusing because
pure-stlmap's (key=>value) "elements" correspond to C++ value_types, a
pair<key_type,mapped_type>, and pure-stlmap's values correspond to
mapped_types. The C++ objects for stlset, stlmset and stlhset are the same as
stlmap, stmmap and stlhmap except that pure-stlmap ensures that the second
member of the C++ value_type pair is always NULL.

Defining Customized Containers
------------------------------

You can change the semmantics of some of the pure-stlmap containers by
specifying certain functions when the containers are created.

Each ordered container (stlmap, stlset, stlmmap, and stlmset) has a
key-less-than function that is used to order its elements by key. In addition,
stlmap and stlmmap each have a value-less-than function and a value-equal
function. Two keys are "equivalent" if neither key is key-less-than the
other. For purposes of lexicographical comparisons one element, e1, is less
than another, e2, if (a) e1's key is less-than e2's key and, (b) if the
ordered container is a stlmap or stlmap, e1's value is value-less-than e2's
value. Finally, for purposes of determining if two containers are equal, e1
and e2 are considered to be equal if (a) their keys are equivalent and (b),
ifn the case of stlmap or stlmmap, their values are value-equal. The default
key-less-than function, (<), value-less-than function (<), and value-equal
function generally work well, but customized versions can be specified when
the ordered container is constructed.

The unordered containers (stlhmap and sthset) do not have a key-less-than or a
value-less-than function. Instead, they have a hash function, a key-equal
function and a value-equal function. These default to 'hash', '(===)' and
'(==)' respectively. If e1 and e2 are elements of unordered maps, they are
considered to be equal if they are key-equal and value-equal. Currently, only
the default functions can be use for stlhmap and stlhset.

Accessing and Modifying Elements
--------------------------------

In pure-stlmap, an element can be thought of as occupying a slot that is
identified by its container and key. You can get a pointer to the slot,
referred to as an iterator, and then read or modify the element. ::

   > let sm  = stlmap  ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];

   > let p = find sm "b";
   > get p;
   "b"=>2

   > put p 20;
   20

   > members sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>10,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

If you don't like iterators, you can use pure-stlmap's "key-based" interface. ::

  > get (sm,"c");
  "c"=>3

  > replace sm "c" 30 $$ sm!"c"
  30

  > members sm;
  ["a"=>1,"b"=>20,"c"=>30,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

  > sm!"a";
  1

When it comes to the multi-keyed containers (stlmmap and stlmset), iterators
are used the same as for the unique-keyed containers (stlmap and
stlset). However, because access is always by key, and never by key value
pairs, it is not possible to access use the key-based interface to access a
single element. As a result, the key-based put and get functions work with
the elements associated with a given key on a all or nothing basis. ::

   let smm = stlmmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4];

   > get (smm,"c");
   "c"=>[31,32]

   > replace smm "c" [31,32,33]; members smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"c"=>33,"d"=>4]

   > replace smm "c" []; members smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

Please note that elements are never identified by key value pairs. I.e., the
value never is used to locate an element. Thus, if you want to delete "c"=>32
from smm while preserving "c"=>31 and "c"=>33 using the key-based interface
you have to use put, i.e., you cannot say something like delete_val smm
("c"=>32) ::

It should be noted that in pure-stlmap's key-based interface, all access is
based on keys. You can never, for example, find or erase a specific
(k=>v). You can only access, modify and erase base on key. If this is not
convenient, you can always use iterators to track down and deal with any
element individually.

Finally, it should be noted that you can never modify an element's key, only
its value. If you want to do that, you have to erase the element and insert a
new element.

Iterators and Ranges
--------------------

The native STL interface is based on "iterators" that point to elements in
containers. pure-stlmap provides support for iterators defined on its ordered
containers (stlmap, stlmmap, stlset and stlmset) but not for its unordered
containers (stlhmap and stlhset).

Given a valid iterator you can access, modify or erase the element it points
to.  Given two iterators, i and j, pointing into a ordered container oc, the
range (i,j), denotes oc's elements starting with "oc[i]", the element pointed
to by i, up to but not including oc[j]. In pure-stlmap, this range is denoted
by the tuple (i,j). ::

   > members sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > let i = stl::find sm1 "b"; // get the iterator

   > let j = stl::find sm1 "e";

   > members (i,j);               // get the elements in the range
   ["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4]

It is also possible to define a range using keys. Given an ordered container,
oc, and keys k and l, the range (oc,k,l) consists of all of the elements in
aoc starting with the first element that is not less than k up to but
not including the first element that is greater or equal to l. Note that k and
l do not have to be stored in oc. ::

   > members (sm,"b","e");
   ["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4]

   > members (sm,"c1",smend);
   ["d"=>4,"e"=>5]

When a range is passed to a function provided by pure-stlmap, the keys can be
dropped, in which case the range consists of all of the container's elements.

   > members sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

Please note that support for iterators and ranges is not provided for the
unordered containers (stlhmap and stlhset). Most pure-stlmap functions that act
on ranges can, however, operate on stlhmaps or stlhsets as well, except that,
for stlhmaps and stlhsets, they always operate on all of the container's
elements. Accordingly, whenever the documentation of a function refers to a
range, and the container in question is a a stlhmap or stlhset, the range
simply refers to the container itself.

Functional Interface for Working with Ranges
--------------------------------------------

The usual list operations including map, foldl, do, etc. are available for all
six containers provided by pure-stlmap. They operate directly on the
underlying data, so it is not necessary, for example, to make a list of
elements and foldl over the list.

It is possible to use iterators or key oriented functions to "manually" move
through the elements in a range, as if one were programming in C++, but this
is not recommended unless there is no alternative. As is the case with lists,
your code will probably be faster and easier to understand if you stick with
map, foldl, filter, etc., rather than maintaining pointers, be they iterators
or keys, into a container. E.g.,::

  > filter (\(k=>v)->v mod 2) sm;
   ["a"=>1,"c"=>3,"e"=>5]

Clearly it would be painful move through the elements via a recursive loop
that bumps keys using `next_key` and pushes filtered elements onto a list.

In short, it should be possible to apply most if not all of the functional
programming idioms that you use with lists to the containers provided by
pure-stlmap. A good example of this is the "terms_mult" function in the
poly.pure example in the pure-stlmap/examples directory. 

Modules, Types and Namespaces
=============================

Modules
-------

pure-stlmap provides three separate modules ``stlmap``, ``stlmmap`` and
``stlhmap``. If you want to use a stlmap or stlset, import stlmap. For
stlmmaps and stlmsets import stlmmap and for stlhmaps aor stlhsets import
stlhmap. This separation reflects the idea that ordered maps, unordered maps
and multimaps (and their corresponding set containers) each have unique
charateristics and that they are not meant to be interchangable
implimentations of a common interface. For example, in order to guarantee O(n)
set operations, stl-pure the set operations are defined on the ordered
containers, stlmap, stlset, stlmmap and stlmset, but not on stlhmap or
stlhset.

Namespaces
----------

Global and stl. Operators all in ::. Constructors and types in :: If function
already exists in ::, then :: (e.g., put, get, foldl, etc).

FIX

The stlhmap Module
------------------

If all you want is quick lookup and you don't care about the order of the
elements stored in the container (or use set operations like
map_intersection), stlhamp or stlhset are probably the best choices. They are
simpler and faster that the other containers.

You can import the stlmmap module by adding the following using statement to
your code. ::

  > using stlhmap;

Importing the stlmap module introduces types to describe stlhmap and
stlhset.

.. type:: stlhmap /type
          stlhset /type
          stlhacon /type


The stlmap Module
-----------------

Consider using the stlmap module which provides stlmap or stlset if you want
the elements to be sorted by key or if you are using any set operations
(map_union, map_intersections, etc). In pure-stlmap, these two containers
support ranges and the key oriented functions cache keys and internal pointers
to speed up key based lookups.

You can import the stlmap module by adding the following using statement to
your code. ::

  > using stlmap;

Importing the stlmap module introduces types to describe stlmap and stlset,
their iterators and ranges defined on them. ::

.. type:: stlmap /type
          stlset /type
          stlacon /type

  Types for stlmap and stlset. stlacon includes stlmap and stlset.

.. type stlmap_iter /type
        stlset_iter /type
        stlacon_iter /type

  Types for iterators on a stlmap or stlset. stlacon_iter includes stlmap_iter
  and stlset_iter.

.. type stlacon_rng /type

  A range of elements defined on a stlmap or stlset.


The stlmmap Module
------------------

If you need a multi-keyed container, stlmmap and stlmset, provided by the
stlmmap module, are your only choices. Set operations and ranges are
supported, but the semantics are more complicated than is the case for stlmap
and stlset. Iterator caching by key oriented functions is not provided because
the keys are not unique. For the same reason, the key oriented functions might
are less than ideal when dealing with multi-keyed containers. Using the
pure-stlmap iterator interface might be your best choice.

You can import the stlmmap module by adding the following using statement to
your code. ::

  > using stlmmap;

Importing the stlmmap module introduces types to describe stlmmap and stlmset,
along with their iterators and ranges defined on them.

.. type:: stlmmap /type
          stlmset /type
          stlmacon /type

  Types for stlmmap and stlmset. stlmacon includes stlmmap and stlmset.

 .. type stlmmap_iter /type
        stlmset_iter /type
        stlmacon_iter /type

  Types for iterators on stlmmap and stlmset. stlacon_iter includes
  stlmmap_iter and stlmset_iter.

.. type stlmacon_rng /type

  Type for a range of elements defined on a stlmmap or stlmset.

Container Operations
====================

As mentioned, each of the six associative containers supported by pure-stlmap
has its own set of unique characteristics. On the other hand, they all share
..  So attempt is made to describe each function for all. If follow natural
instincts it should not be hard as it sounds.

Container Construction and Related Operations
---------------------------------------------

New null containers can be constructed using optional parameters that allow
you to specify customized key-less-than functions, default values,
value-less-than and value-equal functions for the ordered associative
containers (stlmap, stlset, stlmmap and stlmset) as well as hash, key-equal
and value-equal functions for the unordered associatived containers (stlhmap
and stlhset).

.. namespace:: ::

.. function:: mkstlmap (kcmp,dflt,vcmp,veql)
              mkstlmmap (kcmp,vcmp,veql)
              mkstlset kcmp
              mkstlmset kcmp
              mkstlhmap (khash,keql,veql)
              mkstlhset (khash,keql)

   Create a new associative container. The key comparison and hash functions,
   kcmp and khash, are required, the other parameters are optional. The
   functions vcmp and veql are used to determine if one value is less than
   another or equal to another, respectively. The function keql is used to
   determine if one key is equal to another. The object dflt is a the
   containers default value. The default values for dflt, vcmp, veql and keql
   are [], (<) (==) and (==) respectively. E.g., ::

   > let xx = mkstlhmap hash;
   > container_info xx;
   0,2,0.0,1.0,hash,(==),(==)

   > let xx = mkstlmap (>);
   > container_info xx;
   0,(>),[],(<),(==)

Convenience functions are provided to construct null containers using default
values.

.. function:: emptystlmap
              emptystlmmap
              emptystlset
              emptystlmset
              emptystlhmap
              emptystlhset

   Create a new associative container using default values.

Convenience functions are also provided to construct an null container and
insert elements into it in one go. The source of the elements can be a list,
vector, a stlvec, or a range defined on another container of the same type as
the new container.

.. function:: stlmap /stlmap src
              stlmmap /stlmmap src
              stlset /stlmap src
              stlmset /stlmmap src
              stlhmap /stlhmap src
              stlhset /stlhmap src

   Create an associative constructor using default values and insert elements
   from src. src can be a list, vector, stlvec or a range defined over a
   container of the same type as the new container. If the new container is
   one of the three maps, the elements of src must be (k=>v) hash-rocket
   pairs.

After a stlhmap or stlhset is created, it is possible to adjust its maximum
load factor and bucket count.

.. namespace:: stl

.. function:: hash_reserve hacon mlf size

   Sets hacon's max_load_factor to mlf, sets the number of buckets to size/mlf
   and rehashes hacon.

.. function:: container_info /stlmmap acon

   If acon is an ordered associative container, returns (is_set, kcmp, dflt,
   vcmp, veql). If is set is true, dflt, vcmp, and veql will be random values
   that should not be used. If acon is unordered, returns (is_set,
   bucket_count, load_factor, max_load_factor, khash, keql, veql), where veql
   has no meaning if is_set is true.

..function:: swap /stlmap acon1 acon2

  Swap the elements of the two containers of the same type.

.. function:: null /stlmap acon

  Return true if acon is null, else false.

.. namespace:: ::

.. function:: prefix # /stlmap acon

  Return the number of elements in acon.

Equality and Comparison
-----------------------

Two associative containers of the same type are considered to be equal if they
contain the same number of elements and if each pair of their corresponding
elements are equal.

.. namespace:: 

.. function:: map_equal /stlmap rng1 rng2

.. function:: infix == /stlmap rng1 rng2
              infix ~= /stlmap rng1 rng2

  Test rng1 and rng2 for equality or nonequality where rng1 and rng2 are
  ranges defined over containers of the same type. ::
 
   > let xx = stlset ss;
   > xx == ss;
   1

Please note that the == defined on all tuples in the prelude will trump
pure-stlmap's == operators when applied to range tuples. E.g.::

   > stl::members ss;
   ["a","b","c","d","e"]

   > let xx  = stl::stlset  ["a","b","c","d"];

   > stl::map_equal (xx,"a","c") (ss,"a","c");
   1

   > (xx,"a","c") == (ss,"a","c");
   0

Thus, for ranges, use map_equal rather than ==. This issue does not arrise
for the other comparison operators such as (<).

.. function:: infix <  /stlmap rng1 rng2

   Traverse the ranges comparing pairs of elements e1 and e2. If e1 is less
   than e2, stop and return true; if e2 is less than e1 then stop and return
   false. If rng1 is exhausted but rng2 is not, return true, else return false. 
   The two ranges must be defined on ordered associative containers of the
   same type.

.. function:: infix >  /stlmap rng1 rng2
              infix <= /stlmap rng1 rng2
              infix >= /stlmap rng1 rng2

  The these three operators are the same as rng2 < rng2, ~(rng1>rng2) and
  ~(rng1<rng2) respectively.

You have to be extra careful when using equivalence and comparison operators
with stlmmaps because elements with the same key and different values are not
necessarily ordered by values. ::

    > let smm2 = stlmmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>32,"c"=>31,"d"=>4];

    > members smm;
    ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4]

    > members smm2;
    ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>32,"c"=>31,"d"=>4]

    > smm == smm2; // probably not what you want
    0 

These operations do not make much sense for a stlmmap unless the equivalent
keys are stored in the order enfored by the stlmmap's value-comp
function. Check your implementation to see if it is even possible to control
the order (C++11 is ok). Please note that the comparison operators are not
provided for unordered containers.

Key Oriented Functions
----------------------

.. namespace:: stl

Most of the following functions are basically convenience functions that are
easier to use than iterators. They cache C++ iterators for faster lookup time
for some commonly occurring sequences of operations.

.. function:: count /stlmap acon k
              member /stlmap acon k

   Returns the number of elements that has k as their key.

.. function:: member /stlmap acon k

   Returns true if acon contains an element that has k as its key.    

.. function infix ! /stlmap acon k

  If acon is not a stlmmap then if acon has an element with key k return its
  value (or matching key if acon is a set), otherwise throw an out_of_bounds
  exception. If acon is a stlmmap then if acon has as least one element with
  key k return a list of values of all the elements with key k, otherwise
  return an null list. E.g.::

    > sm!"c";
    3

    > catch id $ sm!"f";
    out_of_bounds

    > smm!"c";
    [31,32]

    > smm!"f";  // does not throw exception -- returns null list
    []

.. function:: get /stlmap (acon,k)

   Same as (!) except that it returns a key value(s) pair instead of a value.

   > get (sm,smbeg);
   "a"=>1

   > get (smm,"c");
   "c"=>[31,32]

   > get (smm,smbeg);
   "a"=>[1]

.. function:: replace /stlmap uniq_map k v
              replace /stlmap multi_map k src

   Associate v with k (i.e., insert (k=>v)) in uniq_map where uniq_map is a
   stlmap or stlhmap, or associate the elements of src with k in a in
   multi_map, where multi_is a stlmmap. src can be a list or a vector. The
   elements associated with k in multi_map are placed in the same order as
   they appear in src. src can be null.

   > members smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > replace smm "c" [31,33,35,36]; members smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>33,"c"=>35,"c"=>36,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

.. function:: bounding_keys /stlmap rng

   Return a pair of keys, first and last, such that first <= k < last for each
   k, where k is the key of an element in rng. If there is no such last, the
   second member of the returned pair will be stl::smend. If first is the key
   of the first element of rng's container, the first member of the returned
   pair will stl::smbeg. E.g.,

   > members sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > bounding_keys sm;
   stl::smbeg,stl::smend

  > bounding_keys (sm,"a1","e");
   "b","e"

   > members (sm,ans);
   ["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4]

   > bounding_keys (smm,"a","d");
   stl::smbeg,"d"

   > members (smm,ans);
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32]

.. function:: next_key /stlmap oc k
              prev_key /stlmap oc k

   next_key returns the key of the first element in oc, an ordered associative
   container, that has a key that is greater than k. If no such element exists
   or if k is stl::smend, returns stl::smend. prev_key returns the last
   element in oc that has a key that is less that k, or, if no such element
   exists, throws an out_of_bounds execption. If k is not smbeg, smend or an
   element of oc, out_of_bounds exception.

Iterator Cache
--------------

Each stlmap or stlset maintains a cache key-(C++)iterator pairs that are
replaced by all of the key oriented functions described in the previous
section. In addition, insert (of a single element) also caches iterators. When
one of these functions needs to access an element of the stlmap or stlset by
key, it first checks to see if the key is stored in the cache. If so the
function uses the corresponding cached C++ iterator to locate the element
without having to do a O(log n) search. For speed, the key matches only if it
is same element that was cached (i.e., the test is C++ pointer
equality). Erasure of any element in the container clears the cache. [FIX --
is this entirely correct -- be more specific?]

Here are some examples produced by compiling pure-stlmap with a trace function
that shows when caching eliminates a key lookup. FIX -- may now have to
use let key_a = "a" to get caching.

   > member sm "a";
   1

   > sm!"a";
   found iterator for: "a"
   1

   > replace sm "a" 10;
   found iterator for: "a"
   10

   > let k = next_key sm "a";
   found iterator for: "a"

   > let k = next_key sm k;
   found iterator for: "b"

   > put (sm,k) 30;
   found iterator for: "c"
   30

   > members sm;
   ["a"=>10,"b"=>2,"c"=>30,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

In particular, using member followed by a get or put only requires one
lookup. Also, traversing a range with next_key (or prev_key) followed by gets
and puts can be accomplished in linear time (i.e., next_key requires constant
time, assuming the current key is cached, as do put or get after next_key
caches its result). Currently the three most recently accessed iterators are
cached.

Range Access
------------

These functions access ranges defined on ordered containers. They work on the
unordered containers (stlhmap and stlhset) only if range is the entire
container.

.. function:: members /stlmap rng
              members /stlmap rng
              keys /stlmap rng
              vals /stlmap rng

  members and members Return a list of the elments in the range, rng. keys and
  vals return the keys and vals of the ranges elements. E.g.,::

    > members shm;   // cannot do (shm,k1,k2)
   ["d"=>4,"e"=>5,"a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3]

   > keys (sm,"b","e");
   ["b","c","d"]

   > vals (sm,"b","e");
   [2,3,4]

.. function:: vector /stlmap rng
              stlvec /stlmap rng

  Return a vector or stlvec containing the elments of in the range, rng. E.g.,
  ::

.. function:: stream /stlmap rng

  These a lazy versions of (members rng). E.g., ::

   > take 3 $ stream smm;
   ("a"=>1):#<thunk 0xb70f438c>

   > list ans;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31]

.. function range_info /stlmap rng

   Returns a tuple (ok, sac, first, last) where ok is true if the range is
   valid, sac is the container that the range points into, and first and last
   are iterators that define the range. E.g., ::

   > let ok, smx, f, l = stl::range_info (sm1,"b","e");

   > ok, smx === sm1, stl::members (f,l);
   1,1,["b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4]

.. function:: distance /stlmap rng

   Returns the number of elements contained in rng where rng is a range
   defined on an associative container.

Insertion, Erasure and Updating
-------------------------------

Elements can be inserted into associative containers en masse from another
container or individually. In either case, if an item is about to be inserted
in a unique key associative container (stlmap, stlset, stlhmap, stlhset), the
element will not be inserted if the its key is already stored in the target
container. Please note that this behavior is the opposite to that the Pure
standard library's insert which would replace the old element to match the
element being inserted.

Of course elements are always inserted into multi key associative
containers. Note also that keys can be equivalent for these purposes even if
they are not equal in other respects. E.g., a set's less than function might
only depend on a particular field of records that are inserted into it.

..function:: insert /stlmap acon src

  Tries to insert elements in a valid "insert source" into an associative
  container, and then returns the number of elements inserted. A valid "insert
  source" is (a) a single element, (b) a list, vector, stlvec of elements or
  (c), a range over an associative container of the same type as acon. If
  acon is an associative map (stlmap, stlmmap or stlhmap), the elements of src
  must be key value pairs of the form (k=>v). Returns the number of elements
  inserted, if any.

.. namespace:: stl


Here are some insert examples::

   > let smx  = emptystlmap;
   > insert smx {"a"=>1,"b"=>2}; members smx;
   2
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2]

   > let p, ok = insert_elm smx ("a"=>2); get p,ok; // will not replace "a"
   "a"=>1,0

   > put p 2 $ members smx;  // used iterator p to replace "a"'s value by 2
   ["a"=>2,"b"=>2]

   > let smmx = emptystlmmap;
   > insert smmx {"a"=>1,"b"=>2};
     2

   > let p = insert_elm smmx ("a"=>2); get p; // for mmap,returns iterator only
   "a"=>2

   > members smmx;
   ["a"=>1,"a"=>2,"b"=>2]


..function:: replace_with f m (k=>v)

  This function only applies to stlmaps. The effect of this function is as
  follows: (a) if ~member m k then insert m (k=>dflt) else (), where dflt is
  m's dflt value, (b) replacee m k nv when nv = f v (m!k) end. Returns m. E.g.,

   > let src = ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"c"=>4,"c"=>5];

   > let lists = foldl (replace_with (:)) emptystlmap src;
   > members lists;
   ["a"=>[1],"b"=>[2],"c"=>[5,4,3]]

   > let sums = foldl (replace_with (+)) (mkstlmap ((<),0)) src;
   > members sums;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>12]

..function:: erase /stlmap acon
             erase /stlmap (acon,k)
             erase /stlmap (acon,i)
             erase /stlmap (acon,k1,k2)
             erase /stlmap (acon,i,j)

  The first form erases all elements in acon. The second erases all elements
  with key equivalent to k. The third erases the element pointed by the
  iterator i. The fourth erases the elements in the range (acon,k1,k2). The
  fifth form erases the elements in the range (i,j), assuming i and j are
  iterators on acon. Note that the fourth and fifth forms only apply to the
  ordered containers, not stlhmap or stlhset (because ranges and iterators are
  not defined for stlhmap or stlhset). Returns the number of elements removed
  from the container. E.g.,::

   > members smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]
   > erase (sm,"z");
   0
   > erase (smm,"c");
   2
   > members smm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > erase (smm,"b","e");
   2
   > members smm;;
   ["a"=>1,"e"=>5]

   > members ss;
   ["a","b","c","d","e"]
   > let _,_,i,j = range_info (ss,"b","e");
   > erase (ss,i,j);
   3
   > members ss;
   ["a","e"]

Functional Programming List-Like Operations
===========================================

pure-stlmap provides the most commonly used list-like operations, implemented
to act directly on the underlying data structures. Additional list like
operations, such as scanl, can be simulated by using members (or stream) to
produce a list of elements and then applying the operation to the list.

The first two rows of "standard" list-like operations are applicable all six
associative containers while the last row is applicable only to the ordered
containers.

   * do, map, listmap, catmap, foldl, foldl1

   * rowmap, rowcatmap, colmap, colcatmap

   * foldr, foldr1, filter

Except for their domain, ranges defined on associative containers, these
functions are the same as the corresponding list functions in the Pure
standard Library. E.g.,

   > members sm;
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > map (\(k=>v)->k+str v) (sm,"b","e");
   ["b2","c3","d4"]

   > foldr1 (\(k=>v) (ks=>sum)-> (k+ks=>v+sum)) (sm,"b","e");
   "bcd"=>9

   > filter (\(k=>v)->v mod 2) sm;
   ["a"=>1,"c"=>3,"e"=>5]

The list functions provided are sufficient to support list and matrix
comprehensions for all six of pure-stlmap's containers. ::

   > [ k + str v | (k=>v) = (sm,"b","e")];
   ["b2","c3","d4"]

   > [ k=>v | (k=>v) = sm; v mod 2];
   ["a"=>1,"c"=>3,"e"=>5]

   > { {k;v} |  (k=>v) = sm; v mod 2};
   {"a","c","e";1,3,5}


Set Algorithms
==============

pure-stlmap provides wrappers for the STL set algorithms that apply to ranges
defined on the four ordered associative containers. These algorithms are very
efficient, with linear time complexity, but they do require that the elements
of the two ranges are ordered. Accordingly, the set algorithms are not
applicable to stlhmap or stlhset. Also, when dealing with stlmmaps care must
be taken to ensure that items with the same key are ordered by their
values. If this is not possible, it might be better to use a stlmap with
buckets for values (with appropriately customized less-than and equal
operators).

When applied to the multi-keyed containers, stlmmap and stlmset, these
operations do not necessarily produce the same results as their Pure standard
library counter parts. In particular, when applied to multi-keyed contaners,
map_union is multiset map_union while (+) in the Pure standard library is the
multiset sum. If you want the multiset sum of a stlmmap or stlhmap, use
map_merge.

..function:: map_merge /stlmap rng1 rng2

  Construct a new ordered container from rng1 and then insert rng2 and return
  it. rng1 and rng2 must be defined on the same type of ordered container.

..function:: map_union /stlmap rng1 rng2
             map_difference /stlmap rng1 rng2
             map_intersection /stlmap rng1 rng2
             map_symmetric_difference /stlmap rng1 rng2
             map_includes /stlmap rng1 rng2

   Returns a new ordered associative container of the same type as the ordered
   containers underlying rng1 and rng2. If the ranges are defined over a
   stlmap or stlmmap elements of rng1 have priority over the elments of rng2.

Please note that in pure-stlmap, the left hand set has priority of elements
while in the Pure standard library the right hand set has priority of
elements. Here are some examples that show how these operations differ from
those in the Pure standard library. ::

   > let smm1 = stlmmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32];
   > let smm2 = stlmmap ["c"=>32,"c"=>32,"c"=>33,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];

   > members $ map_merge smm1 smm2; // three "c"=>32
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"c"=>32,"c"=>32,"c"=>33,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > members $ map_union smm1 smm2;  // two "c"=>32
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"c"=>32,"c"=>33,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > let sm1 = stlmap ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31];
   > let sm2 = stlmap ["c"=>32,"d"=>4,"e"=>5];

   > members $ map_union sm1 sm2; // "c"=>31 from sm1, not "c"=>32 from sm2
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > members $ map_intersection sm1 sm2; // "c"=>31 from sm1
   ["c"=>31]


Iterator Interface
==================

Iterator support is provided only for the ordered associative containers,
stlmap, stlset, stlmmap and stlmset. 

Exceptions
----------

In pure-stlmap functions that accept iterators throw a bad_argument exception
if called with an invalid iterator. An iterator remains valid until the
element it was pointing to has been erased. These functions also attempt to
throw bad argument exceptions for bad uses that would otherwise result in
undefined behavior. An example of an invalid use would be a range specified by
iterators from different containers. Here are some examples of iterator
errors. ::


   > let i,j = find sm "a", find sm "d";

   > get i, get j;
   "a"=>1,"d"=>4

   > members (i,j);
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>3]

   > catch id $ members (j,i); // j and i transposed, C++ would segfault
   bad_argument

   > erase (sm,"b");  // erase "b"=>2, leaving i and j valid
   1

   > get i; // still valid
   "a"=>1

   > erase (sm,"a");  // erase "a"=>1 - invalidating i
   1

   > catch id $ get i; // bad iterator exception
   bad_argument


Functions
---------

The functions in this section never cache c++ iterators, on the assumption
that if you call them you are not using the key-oriented functions. [FIX --
change?]

..function:: iterator /stlmap i
             begin /stlmap acon
             pastend /stlmap acon

  Return a new iterator that points to the same element as i, or return
  acon's begin or past-end iterator.

..function:: find /stlmap acon k
 
  Create a new iterator that points to the element with key equivalent to k or
  acon's past-end iterator if none exists.

..function:: insert_elm /stlmap acon elm

  If acon is an associative map and elm is a key value pair, (k=>v), attempts
  to insert (k=>v) into acon.  If acon is an associative set, and elm is not a
  valid insert source, attempts to insert elm into acon. If acon is a
  multi-keyed container, returns an iterator pointing to the element with key
  k that was just inserted. If acon is uniquely keyed, returns a pair, the
  first of which is an iterator pointing to the element with key k that was
  just inserted (or the pre-existing element that blocked the insertion). The
  second element in the pair is a boolean value that is true if a new element
  was inserted.

..function:: insert_elm /stlmap acon (elm,p)

  This is the same as the previous function except that (a) p is passed in as
  a hint to where the new element should be inserted and (b) a single iterator
  is returned rather than a iterator,boolean pair. If the new element is
  inserted just after p, the insertion can have constant time complexity.

..function:: l_bound /stlmap acon k

  Return a new iterator that points to the first element in acon that is not
  less than k, or acon's past-end iterator if none exists.
 
..function:: u_bound /stlmap acon k

  Return a new iterator that points to the first element in acon that is
  greater than k, or acon's past-end iterator if none exists.
 
..function:: lu_bounds /stlmap acon k

  Return the pair l_bound acon k, u_bound acon k.

..function:: inc /stlmap iter
             dec /stlmap iter
             move /stlmap iter n
  
  Move iter forward one, back one or forward n elements respectively, where n
  can be negative.  The iterator us mutated by these operations, provided the
  move is successful. An attempt to move to a position before the first
  element's position causes a out-of-bounds exception. Moves past the last
  element return the acon's past-end iterator

..function:: get /stlmap i
             get_key i
             get_val i

  Return the element pointed to by the iterator i, or the element's key or
  value. For maps the element is returned as a key=>value hash rocket
  pair. For sets, get_elem, get_key and get_val all return the element (which
  is the same as its key).

..function:: put_val i newvalue

  Change the value of the element pointed to by i to newvalue. The element's
  key cannot be changed. The iterator must point into a map, not a set.

..function:: beginp /stlmap i
             pastendp /stlmap i

  Returns true if the iterator i is it's acon's begin iterator or its pastend
  iterator.

..function:: get_info /stlmap i

  Returns a tuple (is_valid,acon,key,val) where is_valid is true if the
  iterator i is valid or false if not, acon is the acon that i points into,
  and key, val are the key and value of the element i points to, if any. If i
  is the past-end iterator, key and value are FIX.

.. function:: infix == /stlmap i j
   
   Returns true if the iterators i and j point to the same element.

 .. function:: infixr ^ /stlmap m k

   Returns an iterator pointing to the element in m, a stlmap, with key k. If
   no such element existed before the call, one is created using map's default
   value.

Here are some examples using iterators. 

   > let b,e = begin smm, pastend smm;

   > members (b,e);
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>32,"d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > let i,j = lu_bounds smm "c";

   > members (b,i);
   ["a"=>1,"b"=>2]

   > members (i,j);
   ["c"=>31,"c"=>32]

   > members (j,e);
   ["d"=>4,"e"=>5]

   > get i;
   "c"=>31

   > get (inc i);
   "c"=>32

   > put i 132;
   132

   > map (\(k=>_)->k=>ord k) (b,i);
   ["a"=>97,"b"=>98,"c"=>99]

   > let is_set, smm1, k, v = get_info i; is_set, members smm1, k, v;
   1,["a"=>1,"b"=>2,"c"=>31,"c"=>132,"d"=>4,"e"=>5],"c",132

   > get (dec j);
   "c"=>132

   > inc j $$ inc j $$ get j;
   "e"=>5

   > inc j $$ pastendp j;
   1
