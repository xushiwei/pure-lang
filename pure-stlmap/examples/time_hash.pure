/* time_hash.pure -- lookup times for hashdict and stlhmap.

   Usage: > run time_hash.pure
          > main num_words_in_hash_table

   A lookup is a sequence like "if member set x then set!x else ()". The
   corresponding c functions are called, e.g., hashdict_member rather than
   member.

   There are two tests applicable to both hashdict stlhmap. The "fast" test
   calls the underlying c functions directly. The "plain" test uses the
   Pure member and (!) functions. 

   The "wrapped" test, applicable only to stlhmap, uses versions of member and
   (!) specialized on (STLHMAP x) as opposed to the stlhmap type (a pointer
   tag). The "p_" and the "w_" tests, applicable only to stlhmap, are the
   like plain and wrapped (i.e., comparing pointer tag to data type based
   dispatch) except that they use unique names (e.g., p_member i/o member).

   The fast times for hashdict and stlhmap are basically the same.

   The times for the plain and wrapped tests depend on the order of the using
   statements for stlhmap and hashdict. If stlhmap comes first in the using
   statement, the stlhmap plain time is about 60% slower than the stlhmap
   wrapped time, and the hashdict time is about 50% slower than the stlhmap
   plain time. However if hashdict comes first in the using statement, both
   the stlhmap times are about 50% slower than the hashdict plain time.

   The times for p_ and w_ tests are, of course, not affected by the order of
   the using statements because they have unique names. Either way, the p_
   time is about 50% slower than the the w_ time.

   Please note that if you want to test changing the the using statement, you
   have to quit and restart Pure, as "clear" will not reload the modules.
