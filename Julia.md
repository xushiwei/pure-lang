# The Julia Programming Language #

[Julia](http://julialang.org/) is "a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments."

Like Pure, Julia has a JIT compiler based on LLVM. An interface between Pure and Julia is planned, but will have to wait until Julia provides the facilities to make its LLVM bitcode available to third-party compilers.
