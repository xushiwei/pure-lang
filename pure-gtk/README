Pure GTK+ bindings

These are just straight 1-1 wrappers of the C libraries, created with
pure-gen. They allow you to do GUI programming with Pure, using the well-known
GTK toolkit, see http://library.gnome.org. The bindings include the gtk
(+gdk), glib, atk, cairo and pango libraries, each in their own Pure module.

See examples/hello.pure for a basic example. To install, do the usual 'make &&
sudo make install' (see the Makefile for further options). This needs Pure and
the GTK header files and libraries. Run 'make generate' to regenerate the
bindings; for this you also need to have pure-gen installed.

See COPYING for copyright information.

Enjoy.
