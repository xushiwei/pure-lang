.SH DESCRIPTION
Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term
rewriting. Pure programs are basically collections of equational rules used to
evaluate expressions in a symbolic fashion by reducing them to normal form.
.PP
.B pure
is the Pure interpreter. The interpreter has an LLVM backend which
JIT-compiles Pure programs to machine code, hence programs run blazingly fast
and interfacing to C modules is easy, while the interpreter still provides a
convenient, fully interactive environment for running Pure scripts and
evaluating expressions.
.PP
Basically, to run a Pure script with the interpreter, just specifiy the
filename of the script on the command line. You can also invoke the
interpreter without arguments, in which case it starts up in interactive mode.
Or you can compile a script to either an LLVM assembler (.ll) file or a native
executable with the
.B -c
option (use
.B -o
to specify the output filename); this currently requires that you have the
LLVM toolchain (llvmc, llvm-gcc, etc.) installed.
.PP
The full version of this manual can be read inside the interpreter, by typing
.B help
on the interpreter's command line. This requires
.BR w3m (1)
to work. (You can also set the name of another html browser to use with the
.B PURE_HELP
or the
.B BROWSER
environment variable.)
.SH FILES
.TP
.B a.out
Default output filename for batch compilation (-c).
.TP
.B ~/.pure_history
Interactive command history.
.TP
\fB~/.purerc\fP, \fB.purerc\fP, \fB.pure\fP
Interactive startup files. The latter is usually a dump from a previous
interactive session.
.TP
.B prelude.pure
Standard prelude. If available, this script is loaded before any other
definitions, unless
.B -n
was specified.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B BROWSER
If the
.B PURE_HELP
variable is not set (see below), this specifies a colon-separated list of
browsers to try for reading the online documentation. See
\fIhttp://www.catb.org/~esr/BROWSER/\fP.
.TP
.B PURELIB
Directory to search for library scripts, including the prelude. If
.B PURELIB
is not set, it defaults to some default location specified at installation
time.
.TP
.B PURE_COPTS
Extra options to be passed to llvmc in a batch compilation (-c).
.TP
.B PURE_HELP
Browser to use to read online documentation in the interpreter. By default,
.BR w3m (1)
is used.
.TP
.B PURE_INCLUDE
Additional directories (in colon-separated format) to be searched for included
scripts.
.TP
.B PURE_LIBRARY
Additional directories (in colon-separated format) to be searched for dynamic
libraries.
.TP
.B PURE_MORE
Shell command to be used for paging through output of the
.B show
command, when the interpreter runs in interactive mode.
.TP
.B PURE_PS
Command prompt used in the interactive command loop (">\ " by default).
.TP
.B PURE_STACK
Maximum stack size in kilobytes (default: 0 = unlimited).
