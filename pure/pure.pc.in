# Extra libraries required for static linking. These flags pull in any shared
# libraries that libpure itself was linked against. They will be added to the
# output if pkg-config is invoked with --static --libs. (Usually you shouldn't
# have to worry about this, since at present the runtime can't be linked as a
# separate static library anyway.)

# Shared library extension and platform-specific extra compilation and linker
# flags required for building shared modules. These are useful for figuring
# out which extension and options are required to build Pure modules on the
# host platform. (These variables aren't actually used below, but are provided
# for convenience so that they can be queried in module Makefiles using
# pkg-config's --variable option.)
