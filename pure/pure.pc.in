# Extra libraries required for static linking. These flags pull in any shared
# libraries that libpure was linked against. They will be added if pkg-config
# is invoked with --static --libs. (Usually you shouldn't have to worry about
# this, since at present the runtime can't be linked as a separate static
# library anyway.)

# Shared library extension and platform-specific extra compilation and linker
# flags required for building shared modules. These are useful for figuring
# out how to build Pure modules on the host platform. (These variables aren't
# actually used below, but are provided for convenience so that they can be
# queried in module Makefiles using pkg-config's --variable option.)
