  As with other <TeXmacs> session inserts, these snippets aren't just
  verbatim Pure code, they are <em|real interactions> with the Pure
  interpreter, so you can rerun the calculations or enter your own code. By
  these means you can use <TeXmacs> as a frontend for the Pure interpreter;
  please check the <TeXmacs> documentation, section ``<TeXmacs> \ as an
  interface'', for details. To make this work, you'll have to install the
  plugin first so that <TeXmacs> knows about it; instructions for that can be
  found in the <hlink|Pure installation instructions|http://docs.pure-lang.googlecode.com/hg/install.html#texmacs-mode>.
  The distributed configuration actually defines various different types of
  Pure sessions, each with their own options for the Pure interpreter, and
  it's easy to add your own if needed.

  Another session type (<verbatim|pure-debug>, this runs the interpreter in
  debugging mode):

  <section|Completion and Help>

  Completion of Pure keywords and functions is fully supported in <TeXmacs>.
  Just type <key|Tab> as usual and <TeXmacs> displays a list of possible
  completions in its status line. Pressing <key|Tab> again you can cycle
  through the completions and pick the one that you want. For instance, you
  can try this yourself on the following input line by placing the cursor
  behind the <verbatim|f> and hitting the <key|Tab> key:

  <\session|pure|default>
    <\input>
      \<gtr\>\ 
    <|input>
      f
    </input>
  </session>

  The Pure <verbatim|help> command also works in <TeXmacs>. By default, this
  will pop up a new <TeXmacs> window with the help file in it. Search terms
  also work as usual; you might want to try the following to find out how the
  Pure help system works (this may take a while to load, so be patient):

  <\session|pure|default>
    <\input>
      \<gtr\>\ 
    <|input>
      help online-help
    </input>
  </session>

  Note that Pure's online help is in html format by default. While <TeXmacs>
  can load html files, it has to convert them to its own format first, which
  at least in the current version of <TeXmacs> is quite slow and the
  rendering isn't perfect. There's <TeXmacs>-formatted online documentation
  available on the Pure website which you can install to alleviate this, see
  the Pure installation instructions for details. If you still prefer the
  html documentation, then it's also possible to use an external graphical
  html browser instead. Just set the <verbatim|PURE_HELP> shell environment
  variable accordingly, the interpreter will then use that command to display
  the online help.<\footnote>
    Note that the <verbatim|PURE_HELP> environment variable also works
    outside of <TeXmacs>, i.e., when the interpreter is run from Emacs or the
    shell. The <verbatim|BROWSER> environment variable, however, does
    <em|not> change the way that the <verbatim|help> command works in
    <TeXmacs>, so you can use this variable instead to specify a browser
    program for use outside of <TeXmacs> only.
  </footnote>

  <section|Math Input and Output>

  The Pure plugin fully supports math input and output. These are enabled as
  follows:

  <\itemize>
    <item>To use math <em|input>, you can toggle the input line between math
    and program (verbatim) mode using the <key|Ctrl+$> key combination. This
    isn't a standard <TeXmacs> keybinding, but is defined at the beginning of
    the <verbatim|pure-init.scm> script for your convenience; you can edit
    the script to change this according to your preferences. Of course, you
    can also use the corresponding <samp|Focus \| Input options \|
    Mathematical input> menu option or the equivalent toolbar item; these
    become visible when the cursor is located at the input line. Or you can
    make math input the default when the Pure <TeXmacs> plugin is loaded by
    putting the following Scheme command into your
    <verbatim|my-init-texmacs.scm> file:

    <\scm-code>
      (if (not (session-math-input?)) (toggle-session-math-input))
    </scm-code>

    <item>To enable math <em|output>, you'll need to import the Pure
    <verbatim|texmacs> module. The <verbatim|math> function in this module
    switches output to <LaTeX> math, as provided by the Reduce
    <verbatim|tmprint> package (thus this feature really needs the
    <verbatim|pure-reduce> module). The <verbatim|verbatim> function switches
    back to verbatim Pure output. Verbatim output is also used as a fallback
    in math mode for all Pure expressions which cannot be printed through the
    Reduce interface (typically because they aren't valid Reduce
    expressions).

    You can make math output the default by enabling the <verbatim|tmmath>
    conditional compilation option on the Pure side. This can be set
    interactively by entering the following pragma at the input line
    <em|before> loading the <verbatim|texmacs> module:

    <\verbatim-code>
      #! --enable tmmath
    </verbatim-code>

    Alternatively, you can also set the <verbatim|PURE_OPTION_TMMATH>
    variable in your process environment or you shell's startup files to
    enable this option.
  </itemize>

  Here's a little example, running the Reduce computer algebra system in
  Pure:

  <\session|pure|reduce>
    <\unfolded-io>
      \<gtr\>\ 
    <|unfolded-io>
      using reduce, texmacs; math;
    <|unfolded-io>
      Reduce (Free CSL version), 23-Oct-12 ...

      ()
    </unfolded-io>

    <\unfolded-io-math>
      \<gtr\>\ 
    <|unfolded-io-math>
      simplify <around*|(|df <around*|(|sin<around*|(|x<rsup|2>|)>|)> x|)>;
    <|unfolded-io-math>
      <with|color|black|mode|math|math-display|true|2*cos
      <around*|(|x<rsup|2>|)>*x>
    </unfolded-io-math>

    <\unfolded-io-math>
      \<gtr\>\ 
    <|unfolded-io-math>
      simplify <around*|(|intg <around*|(|cos <around*|(|x+y|)><rsup|2>|)>
      x|)>;
    <|unfolded-io-math>
      <with|color|black|mode|math|math-display|true|<frac|cos
      <around*|(|x+y|)>*sin <around*|(|x+y|)>+x|2>>
    </unfolded-io-math>
  </session>

  <section|PostScript Output>

  Like the Python plugin, Pure can pipe PostScript graphics directly into
  <TeXmacs>. This is done with the <verbatim|ps> function from the
  <verbatim|texmacs> module which takes either verbatim PostScript code
  (indicated by a <verbatim|%!> header) or a PostScript filename as its
  string argument. In the latter case, if the PostScript filename doesn't
  have a slash in it, it is searched for in the directory of the current
  buffer (if any) and all directories on the <verbatim|TEXMACS_DOC_PATH>, and
  a <verbatim|.eps> or <verbatim|.ps> suffix is added automatically when
  needed. Otherwise the filename is interpreted relative to the directory in
  which <TeXmacs> was started.

  Here is a simple example illustrating verbatim PostScript code:

  <\session|pure|postscript>
    <\input>
      \<gtr\>\ 
    <|input>
      using texmacs;
    </input>

    <\unfolded-io>
      \<gtr\>\ 
    <|unfolded-io>
      ps "%!\\n%%BoundingBox: 195 295 405 405\\n/Times-Roman findfont 20

      -200 0 rlineto 0 -100 rlineto 235 345 moveto (Hello, world!) show
      closepath stroke showpage";
    <|unfolded-io>
      <image|<tuple|<#25210A2525426F756E64696E67426F783A203139352032393520343035203430350A2F54696D65732D526F6D616E2066696E64666F6E74203230207363616C65666F6E7420736574666F6E74206E6577706174682032303020333030206D6F7665746F20323030203020726C696E65746F20302031303020726C696E65746F202D323030203020726C696E65746F2030202D31303020726C696E65746F2032333520333435206D6F7665746F202848656C6C6F2C20776F726C6421292073686F7720636C6F736570617468207374726F6B652073686F7770616765>|ps>||||>

      ()
    </unfolded-io>
  </session>

  <section|Pure Scripting>

  Last but not least, Pure can also be used as a <em|scripting language> in
  <TeXmacs>, as described at the end of the ``<TeXmacs> \ as an interface''
  section. This is done by enabling the <samp|Document \| Scripts \| Pure>
  option (or <samp|Document \| Scripts \| Pure-math> if you prefer math
  output; this is what we use here).

  <\bothlined>
    <strong|Note: >If you're reading this in the <TeXmacs> help browser, then
    Pure scripting will most likely not be enabled yet, so you should do this
    now if you'd like to try the examples below.
  </bothlined>

  Scripting uses its own instance of the Pure interpreter which is separate
  from all Pure sessions that might be included in the same document. It
  gives you both executable input fields and spreadsheets whose cells can be
  evaluated in the Pure interpreter. For instance:

  Enter <math|x> here: <with|font-base-size|14|<calc-inert|x|a+b>>. This is
  the value of <math|x> squared: <with|font-base-size|14|<calc-output|x
  squared|<calc-ref|x>^2|<with|color|black|mode|math|math-display|true|a<rsup|2>+2*a*b+b<rsup|2>>>>.

  Position the cursor in the right field above and hit <key|Return> twice to
  toggle between the computed Pure expression and its value. You can also
  change the value in the left field and hit <key|Return> to have the right
  field recomputed.

  An even more convenient way to have Pure compute values in a <TeXmacs>
  document are spreadsheets. Here is an example of a textual spreadsheet
  (<samp|Insert \| Table \| Textual spreadsheet>) showing some Pure and
  Reduce calculations. As before, you can type <key|Return> in the cells of
  the last column to reveal the underlying Pure formulas; also try changing
  some of the values in the <verbatim|b> and <verbatim|c> columns and hitting
  <key|Return> to recompute the corresponding values in the last column.

  <with|font-base-size|12|<\calc-table|table1>

    b5 c5|<with|color|black|mode|math|math-display|true|2*<around*|(|x+y|)>>>>>>>>

    \;
  </calc-table>>

  You can also refer to a table field in text like this:
  <with|font-base-size|12|<calc-output|field3|<calc-ref|table1-d4>|<with|color|black|mode|math|math-display|true|2*cos<around*|(|x<rsup|2>|)>*x>>>.
  Here we set the Ref field of the table to <verbatim|table1>; the reference
  to cell <verbatim|d4> can then be entered with the following series of key
  strokes: <key|\\ ! \\ ?> <verbatim|table1-d4> <key|Return>.

  <section|More Information>

  This is just a very brief overview of the facilities provided by this
  plugin. Using Pure's Octave and Reduce interfaces, Pure can be employed as
  a full-featured scientific computing environment in <TeXmacs>, and with the
  other addon modules available for Pure you can extend <TeXmacs> in various
  useful ways. More information can be found in the full version of this
  manual, which is available in printable format in the
  <hlink|pure-texmacs.en.tm|pure-texmacs.en.tm> file. (This file won't be
  rendered correctly inside the <TeXmacs> help system, so you should locate
  it in the plugins/doc directory and open it as a regular <TeXmacs> document
  in order to print it.)
