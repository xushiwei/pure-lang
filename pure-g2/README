This is a straight wrapper of the g2 graphics library, see http://g2.sf.net/.
License: BSD-style, see the COPYING file for details.

g2 is a simple, no-frills 2D graphics library, distributed under the LGPL.
It's easy to use, portable and supports PostScript, X11, PNG and Win32. Just
the kind of thing that you need if you want to quickly knock out some basic
graphics, and whipping out the almighty OpenGL or GTK/Cairo seems overkill.

To use this module, you need to have libg2 installed as a shared library
(libg2.so, .dll etc.) in a place where the Pure interpreter can find it.

There's no 'make install', just copy g2.pure to some convenient location
(e.g., the Pure library directory). Examples can be found in g2_test.pure and
g2_life.pure.

A Makefile is included which provides the following targets:

- Just 'make' compiles the examples to native executables.

- 'make clean' deletes the native executables for the examples, as well as
  some graphics files which are produced by running g2_test.pure.

- 'make generate' regenerates the g2.pure module. This requires that you have
  pure-gen installed, but shouldn't normally be necessary, unless you find
  that the provided wrapper doesn't work with your g2 version. The provided
  g2.pure has been generated from g2 0.72.

Enjoy. :)
